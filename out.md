**Geralt of Rivia** was a legendary [witcher](/wiki/Witcher "Witcher") of the [School of the Wolf](/wiki/School_of_the_Wolf "School of the Wolf") active throughout the [13th century](/wiki/Timeline "Timeline"). He loved the [sorceress](/wiki/Sorceress "Sorceress") [Yennefer](/wiki/Yennefer_of_Vengerberg "Yennefer of Vengerberg"), considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship, and became [Ciri](/wiki/Ciri "Ciri")'s adoptive father.

During the [Trial of the Grasses](/wiki/Trial_of_the_Grasses "Trial of the Grasses"), Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the [mutagens](/wiki/Mutagens "Mutagens") that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and [stamina](/wiki/Stamina "Stamina") than his fellow witchers.

Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of [Rivia](/wiki/Rivia_(city) "Rivia (city)"). After being left with the witchers by his mother, [Visenna](/wiki/Visenna "Visenna"), he grew up in their keep of [Kaer Morhen](/wiki/Kaer_Morhen "Kaer Morhen") in the realm of [Kaedwen](/wiki/Kaedwen "Kaedwen"). In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master [Vesemir](/wiki/Vesemir "Vesemir"). As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all that remained of his chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic. Later, [Queen](/wiki/Queen "Queen") [Meve](/wiki/Meve "Meve") of [Lyria](/wiki/Lyria "Lyria") knighted him for his valor in the [Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga](/wiki/Battle_for_the_Bridge_on_the_Yaruga "Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga") conferring on him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused him.[[2]](#cite_note-bof-3) He, therefore, became a true [knight](/wiki/Knight "Knight").

![toggle section](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/36002e46-06fe-4633-9d99-27d96cf5bcdc)

The Trial of The Grasses was a painful process that used a mysterious mixture of plants, elixirs, and other unknown ingredients to modify the physiology of young witcher adepts to make them fully fledged witchers in terms of reflexes and heightened senses. However, this process caused so much strain on an adept's body, only about 3 to 4 out of every 10 adepts survived, with the rest dying in agony.

Biography
---------

Geralt was born as the son of the sorceress Visenna and presumably, the warrior [Korin](/wiki/Korin "Korin"). Shortly after his birth, his mother left him with the School of the Wolf at the stronghold of Kaer Morhen. There, Geralt was made and trained to become a Witcher.

As a child, he was subjected to the [Trial of The Grasses](/wiki/Witcher_Trials "Witcher Trials"). He managed to survive the many blistering mutations required to grant Witchers their abilities. After displaying unusual tolerance, Geralt was selected for further experimental mutations which granted him considerably greater strength, speed, endurance, resilience, healing, senses, complete immunity to diseases and conventional poisons, and extreme resistance to pain. This resulted in his hair turning white, and he received the nickname "White Wolf".

Geralt was trained by his mentor Vesemir, whom he came to regard as a father figure. He soon met his fellow classmate [Eskel](/wiki/Eskel "Eskel"), and the two became good friends and as close as brothers. One time, they captured a large forest bumblebee and tied it to a jug. The pair laughed at its antics until they were discovered by Vesemir who punished them with a leather strap.[[3]](#cite_note-tlw-4)

### Early life

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)

***"This is my story, not yours. You must let me finish telling it."*** — This article/section is a [stub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Stub"). You can help Witcher Wiki by [expanding it](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Geralt_of_Rivia?action=edit).

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)

Due to his brilliant success in training, Geralt was selected for additional mutation experiments. He was the only witcher to have survived these experiments, his stark white hair being a side effect of these additional mutations. He also spent time training with Mother Assumpta and priestess [Nenneke](/wiki/Nenneke "Nenneke") at the Temple of Melitele in Elsborg.[[1]](#cite_note-cor-1) After completing his witcher training, Geralt set off into the world on a [horse](/wiki/Horse "Horse") named [Roach](/wiki/Roach "Roach"), a name he would bestow upon every one of his later horses. Thus, he became a monster slayer for hire.

Originally, Geralt was convicted and enthusiastic, holding faith that he was needed in a world full of monsters and beasts to protect the innocent, although Vesemir greatly advised him not to play at being a knight errant or uphold the law. After travelling about 50 miles after leaving Kaer Morhen, Geralt was anxious to kill his first monster. He encountered a bald man with rotten teeth, who stopped a peasant's cart and pulled out a young girl whilst his companions held down her father as the bald man tore off her dress yelling it was time for her to meet a real man and attempted to rape her. Geralt rode up and told him the time had come for him to meet one too. The thug released the girl and charged at him with an axe. Geralt managed to strike him twice with his blade and killed him. The young witcher turned, expecting gratitude, but the father fled with the attackers, and the girl, who was drenched in the man's blood, vomited, became hysterical, and then fainted in fear when Geralt approached her. This event caused Geralt to rarely interfere with such matters.[[3]](#cite_note-tlw-4)

Following advice from Nenneke, at one point during or after [1231](/wiki/Timeline#1231 "Timeline")[[1]](#cite_note-cor-1) he began to study at [Oxenfurt Academy](/wiki/Oxenfurt_Academy "Oxenfurt Academy"), where he attended some lectures including [astronomy](/wiki/Astromancy "Astromancy").[[4]](#cite_note-sos-5)

Over the years, Geralt traveled across the [continent](/wiki/Continent "Continent"). He visited towns and fortresses looking for proclamations nailed to the posts at crossroads with the words 'Witcher urgently needed'. His adventures led him to sacred sites, dungeons, necropolis, ruins, forest ravines, and hidden grottos in the mountains. Throughout his career he killed a [manticore](/wiki/Manticore "Manticore"), [wyvern](/wiki/Wyvern "Wyvern"), [fogler](/wiki/Fogler "Fogler"), [aeschna](/wiki/Aeschna "Aeschna"), [ilyocoris](/wiki/Ilyocoris "Ilyocoris"), [chimera](/wiki/Chimera "Chimera"), [leshy](/wiki/Leshy "Leshy"), [vampire](/wiki/Vampire "Vampire"), [ghoul](/wiki/Ghoul "Ghoul"), [graveir](/wiki/Graveir "Graveir"), [werewolf](/wiki/Werewolf "Werewolf"), [giant scorpion](/wiki/Giant_scorpion "Giant scorpion"), [striga](/wiki/Striga "Striga"), [black annis](/wiki/Black_annis "Black annis"), [kikimore](/wiki/Kikimore "Kikimore"), and several other creatures.[[3]](#cite_note-tlw-4)

### Butcher of Blaviken

Geralt once visited the town of [Blaviken](/wiki/Blaviken "Blaviken") and befriended the local alderman, [Caldemeyn](/wiki/Caldemeyn "Caldemeyn"). He was invited into his house to share a meal with his family. During their supper, Geralt threw his fork at a rat in complete darkness and killed it in order to practise his witcher senses which he found to be amusing. However, the alderman's wife, [Libushe](/wiki/Libushe "Libushe"), harbored a distrustful opinion of the witcher.

An unknown time later, he killed an [amphisbaena](/wiki/Amphisbaena "Amphisbaena") and went to the court of King [Idi](/wiki/Idi "Idi") of [Kovir](/wiki/Kovir "Kovir"), where he handed in the head of the beast. However the king's [mages](/wiki/Mage "Mage"), [Zavist](/wiki/Zavist "Zavist") and [Stregobor](/wiki/Stregobor "Stregobor"), told the king that Geralt was little more than a charlatan, so the king didn't pay the witcher anything and demanded he leave Kovir in 12 hours, which Geralt was barely able to do on account of the king's hourglass being broken.

Two years later he made his way to Blaviken where the alderman, Caldemeyn, was happy to see the witcher after so many years since Geralt's last visit. While he couldn't offer a reward on a kikimore that Geralt killed nearby, his guards suggested the local mage, [Irion](/wiki/Irion "Irion"), might have some use for it. However, when they arrived at the mage's [tower](/wiki/Irion%27s_tower "Irion's tower"), Geralt immediately saw Irion was actually none other than Stregobor. Once the witcher and mage were alone, the two discussed the past, with Geralt sardonically remarking on how Stregobor talked the former King Idi out of paying him back in Kovir. Pushing this aside, Stregobor revealed he needed Geralt's help: [Renfri](/wiki/Renfri "Renfri"), a bandit and the leader of a [gang](/wiki/Renfri%27s_band "Renfri's band"), was in town looking to kill him, and therefore he wished for the witcher to kill Renfri. Unfazed by this, Geralt remarked it wasn't his problem and left.

Later that night, Geralt and Caldemeyn went to [The Golden Court](/wiki/The_Golden_Court "The Golden Court"), the town's inn where Renfri was staying. Geralt found her gang, though none of them were very cooperative and just made jokes until one member, [Fifteen](/wiki/Fifteen "Fifteen"), challenged him to a fight. However, before it could begin, Renfri appeared and went to talk to Geralt and Caldemeyn in private, with the latter demanding she leave town or be thrown in jail. Unperturbed, Renfri revealed a letter of safe conduct from King [Audoen](/wiki/Audoen "Audoen") which gave her immunity in [Hengfors](/wiki/Hengfors_(city) "Hengfors (city)") and [Arcsea](/wiki/Arcsea "Arcsea"). After another short discussion, Geralt and the alderman left.

That night, as Geralt went to his guest room in Caldemeyn's home, he found Renfri there. She eventually revealed her entire past, including how Stregobor played a part in banishing the [princess](/wiki/Princess "Princess") from [her own kingdom](/wiki/Creyden "Creyden") on account of her being born during a [black sun](/wiki/Black_Sun "Black Sun"), putting into play a constant struggle between the two: her trying to kill the mage and the mage trying to kill her. She then asked Geralt to help her kill Stregobor, but the witcher once again refused to take sides. After telling her she should leave town, Renfri remarked on the [Tridam ultimatum](/wiki/Tridam_ultimatum "Tridam ultimatum"), before agreeing she'd leave the next day, but in the meantime wished to sleep with Geralt, who obliged.

The next morning though, as Geralt ate breakfast with Caldemeyn and his family, the alderman revealed the deadly meaning behind the Tridam ultimatum, making Geralt realize Renfri's ruse was to take the market-goers hostage. He ran off to the market, which was preparing for its busiest day of the year. When he arrived, he found Renfri's gang, who hadn't acted yet, as Renfri went off to give Stregobor the ultimatum first. Not wanting to take chances, Geralt fought with the gang, viciously killing them all off in front of the townspeople before Renfri showed up. She refused to stand down, forcing Geralt to fight and kill her as well. As she died, Stregobor appeared, having seen it all from his [crystal ball](/wiki/Crystal_ball "Crystal ball"), and wished to do an autopsy on the dead princess. However, Geralt threatened to slay the mage if he so much as touched Renfri's body, and thus Stregobor left to return to Kovir. The townspeople, not realizing how close they'd come to being hostages and killed off, proceeded to throw stones at Geralt for his actions until Caldemeyn stepped in to stop it. He then asked for Geralt to leave and never return to Blaviken.[[3]](#cite_note-tlw-4)

### Dealing with Eskel's child surprise

---

The following is considered game canon only and may contradict [Andrzej Sapkowski](/wiki/Andrzej_Sapkowski "Andrzej Sapkowski")'s works.

---

In the fall of [1232](/wiki/Timeline/Games#1232 "Timeline/Games"), Geralt decided to return to Kaer Morhen early but along the way, his horse was killed by [wolves](/wiki/Wolf_(creature) "Wolf (creature)"), and he encountered several [Caingornese](/wiki/Caingorn "Caingorn") camps. He stopped at [one](/wiki/Camp_near_Kaer_Morhen "Camp near Kaer Morhen") to meet [Prince](/wiki/Prince "Prince") [Merwin Ademeyn](/wiki/Merwin_Ademeyn "Merwin Ademeyn") and the sorceress [Sabrina Glevissig](/wiki/Sabrina_Glevissig "Sabrina Glevissig"), as well as the [dwarf](/wiki/Dwarf "Dwarf") [Merton Bringgs](/wiki/Merton_Bringgs "Merton Bringgs"). They had a proposition for Geralt but before Sabrina could discuss it, a pack of wolves attacked them. After they were killed, Geralt then talked to Sabrina who discussed the symptoms of the Curse of the Black Sun, who eventually turned the conversation to Merwin's sister, [Deidre Ademeyn](/wiki/Deidre_Ademeyn "Deidre Ademeyn"), who was in Kaer Morhen and having been born during an eclipse. Sabrina asked Geralt to retrieve her from the keep so she could give Deidre to the [Council of Mages](/wiki/Council_of_Mages "Council of Mages") to be studied, and hopefully find a cure to the curse.

As Geralt left the tent, he was approached by Merwin, who showed him a scroll from King [Henselt](/wiki/Henselt "Henselt") of Kaedwen, who told him that Merwin was under the protection of Kaedwen and anyone defying Merwin defied the kingdom. Shortly after in the woods, Geralt met [Lambert](/wiki/Lambert "Lambert"), who had just killed some wolves, and explained that Merton Bringgs and his group of dwarves had tried to enter the keep, but Lambert caught them. As Geralt entered the keep, he found Vesemir who informed him that Deidre had returned a couple of days earlier, running from her envious brother and an evil sorceress, and that Eskel had told him that Deidre was actually his [surprise child](/wiki/Law_of_Surprise "Law of Surprise") from about 20 years ago. Vesemir then told Geralt to go look for Eskel.

Geralt soon found Eskel, who explained how Deidre had become his surprise child, but ultimately hadn't decided if he should hand her over to Sabrina or not. The two then made their way back to Vesemir, who decided the 4 should vote on it, with it coming down to Geralt's choice as Eskel chose to trust whatever his fellow witcher decided.

*If Geralt voted to keep Deidre safe:* Geralt and Eskel convinced Deidre to go with them to the camp where the prince and the sorceress were. Once there though, despite Deidre agreeing she'd give up any claim to the throne and any titles and estates like her brother wanted, Sabrina then tried to have Merton arrest her. In the ensuing chaos, Deidre struck Eskel, causing deep facial scars, and killed Merton with her sword but Sabrina escaped through a [portal](/wiki/Portal "Portal"). The witchers then entered a fight with Merwin's group before Geralt followed Deidre into Sabrina's tent where he found Deidre, Sabrina, and Merwin. Merwin asked Geralt to kill Deidre, but she pleaded for her life saying she didn't mean to hurt Eskel. Geralt then tried to convince Deidre to let her anger towards Sabrina and her brother go, as that was best for everyone.

:   *Geralt made Deidre drop her sword:* Geralt wasn't impressed that Deidre had struck Eskel and was also annoyed she lied about wanting a peaceful option. He then had to kill Deidre and her wolves.
:   *Geralt made Sabrina leave:* Geralt told the sorceress that her [magic](/wiki/Magic "Magic") was useless and that she should just leave, which she did. Merwin and Deidre forgave each other and left for Caingorn.

*If Geralt told Deidre to leave the keep:* Geralt and Eskel informed Deidre she had to leave, with Eskel explaining she was putting Kaer Morhen in danger by being there. Angry at this, she struck Eskel, causing deep facial scars, and summoned archespores, which attacked the two witchers while she ran off. After dealing with the immediate threats, Geralt informed Vesemir about the situation before going to Sabrina to get her help to heal Eskel, the two later helping him to resolve the matter of Deidre's fate.

The rest of the winter at Kaer Morhen passed more peacefully and Geralt left come spring to continue his trade.[[5]](#cite_note-pn-6)

### Adventures with Dandelion

Geralt traveled to [Gulet](/wiki/Gulet "Gulet") on witcher business, where he met [Dandelion](/wiki/Dandelion "Dandelion"), a poet who later became his best friend, at a fête. Later Dandelion slept with a woman under the musicians' podium, who had four large brothers. Dandelion fled from the city with Geralt and started to build a friendship with him on their way southeast to [Dol Blathanna](/wiki/Dol_Blathanna "Dol Blathanna").[[3]](#cite_note-tlw-4)

After Gulet, Geralt and Dandelion stopped in [Upper Posada](/wiki/Upper_Posada "Upper Posada") to look for work, however the only "monster troubles" the people could come up with were tall tales and creatures that didn't actually exist, so the two soon left to find another place for work. However, on the road, they were soon approached by [Nettly](/wiki/Nettly "Nettly"), who'd seen them in Upper Posada, and explained he did have business for the witcher, who accepted.

Geralt and Dandelion ate supper at the man's house where the group was joined by [Dhun](/wiki/Dhun "Dhun"), the elder of [Lower Posada](/wiki/Lower_Posada "Lower Posada"), who eventually discussed a "deovel" named [Torque](/wiki/Torque "Torque"), who had been somewhat helpful, when not occasionally pulling pranks on the villagers. These pranks were getting out of hand though and they needed something to get rid of Torque, but not kill him.

Agreeing to check it out, the witcher and bard went into the nearby [hemp](/wiki/Hemp "Hemp") field where the "deovel" was known to stay and found "offerings" set up for the creature. As they looked around, Torque appeared but as Geralt tried to talk with the [sylvan](/wiki/Sylvan "Sylvan"), Dandelion started to make jokes at Torque to the point the sylvan began to pelt small, iron balls at the two, making them run off.

After the attack, the two went back to Lower Posada where they met with Dhun and Nettly, who admitted that they had tried to outwit the "deovel" in the past, including trying to trick him into eating the iron pellets he'd thrown at the pair. Eventually, they brought out an old woman and her apprentice, [Lille](/wiki/Lille "Lille"), along with an [ancient book](/wiki/Physiologus "Physiologus"). While the old woman, a Wise One, couldn't read the book, she'd memorized it by heart from knowledge passed down to each wise woman, eventually revealing Torque was a sylvan and the reason they just wanted to drive him away was that Lille didn't want him killed.

With this in mind, the next day Geralt found Torque and, after a quick game of riddles, the witcher threw an iron ball which hit Torque in the forehead. This surprise attack gave Geralt the opportunity to capture Torque and signal to Dandelion, but a horse appeared and hit him, rendering the witcher unconscious.

Shortly after, Geralt woke up to find himself tied up along with Dandelion, with Torque giving [Galarr](/wiki/Galarr "Galarr"), an elf from the [Blue Mountains](/wiki/Blue_Mountains "Blue Mountains"), three sacks of corn, revealing that Torque had been stealing the food to help the starving elves, as well as passing along agricultural tips he learned from the villagers as the elves didn't know how to farm the land. Noticing the awake prisoners, one of the elves, [Toruviel](/wiki/Toruviel "Toruviel"), began to antagonize Geralt before kicking him and smashing Dandelion's lute. Angry at this latter act, Geralt managed to headbutt the elf and another moved to kill the witcher despite Torque's protests that [Filavandrel aén Fidháil](/wiki/Filavandrel_a%C3%A9n_Fidh%C3%A1il "Filavandrel aén Fidháil") forbade killing, when Filavandrel himself showed up to stop everything.

However, it was clear that the leader planned to have the witcher and bard killed, as they were witnesses to what Torque had been doing, though during this Filavandrel and Geralt conversed, with Geralt noting the elf was filled with hatred towards humans and was, despite how his people were starving, too proud to try and cohabit with those he deemed "inferior". As the elves moved to shoot Geralt and Dandelion though, Torque stood in front of the pair, fruitlessly trying to defend anyone from being killed and ignoring Geralt's remark to stand aside. Feeling it was necessary, Filavandrel started to give the order to kill the three when Lille suddenly appeared, but in the form of the goddess [Dana Meadbh](/wiki/Dana_Meadbh "Dana Meadbh"). After silently communicating with the elves, she sent them riding back to the Blue Mountains, but not before Toruviel gave Dandelion her priceless lute for destroying his. Filavandrel then bade farewell to them, remarking Geralt was right about his earlier comments. Later that night, Geralt, Dandelion, and Torque made camp, with Geralt reading over the ancient book he'd collected as his prize for getting rid of Torque, who was moving on from Lower Posada.[[3]](#cite_note-tlw-4)

### Meeting Yennefer

In [1249](/wiki/Timeline#1249 "Timeline"), Geralt and Dandelion traveled to a village where they went fishing but the line snapped and their meal escaped. The two started to fight about who was at fault and started to leave before Dandelion realized the line had caught an old jar that he thought might contain a [djinn](/wiki/Djinn "Djinn"). On realizing there was a mage's seal on the jar, Geralt tried to warn the bard not to touch it but in their scuffle, the seal came off and the djinn appeared. As Geralt grabbed his swords, Dandelion began to make wishes, which only angered the djinn and it grabbed Dandelion's throat. With his weapons doing little damage, Geralt grabbed the seal out of desperation and used the words of an exorcism a priestess had taught him and miraculously the djinn ran off.

However, the bard was badly injured so Geralt hastily made for [Rinde](/wiki/Rinde "Rinde") in hopes of finding someone to help. Despite Dandelion's severe injuries, anyone of low stature wasn't allowed to enter after sunset so all they could do was wait it out with the others there, including [Chireadan](/wiki/Chireadan "Chireadan"), [Errdil](/wiki/Errdil "Errdil"), and [Vratimir](/wiki/Vratimir "Vratimir"). Eventually, the group revealed there was only one known mage in town who could help: Yennefer of Vengerberg who, despite King [Heribert](/wiki/Heribert "Heribert")'s orders that no magic users could stay in [Redania](/wiki/Redania "Redania"), was staying with the honorary [Novigrad](/wiki/Novigrad "Novigrad") ambassador, [Beau Berrant](/wiki/Beau_Berrant "Beau Berrant"), thus giving her asylum while she stayed with him.

As soon as sunrise hit, Geralt made his way to the ambassador's home, knocking out the doorman, [Cerberus](/wiki/Cerberus "Cerberus"), in the process. While he searched the home for the sorceress, he ran into a drunk and naked Berrant, who mentioned a woman wanting juice before he passed out. Geralt got the apple juice, then made his way up to the sorceress' room and gave her the drink, who didn't notice at first that he was not Berrant as she was under the bed covers. However, once she appeared naked from under them, she quickly realized the situation and demanded answers from Geralt, who answered sarcastically, causing her to immediately cast a spell at him which Geralt tried to counter with [Heliotrop](/wiki/Heliotrop "Heliotrop"). Desperate for her help, Geralt changed to a respectful tone, explaining why he'd intruded on her sleep, before eventually revealing the djinn and the exorcism statement he made. However, Yennefer remarked it wasn't an exorcism, just a witty, indecent comment before asking what drove the djinn away and the seal that'd been on the bottle. While Geralt noted it probably went to do one of Dandelion's wishes, he hid the truth about the seal, pretending Dandelion had it. The two then traveled by portal to Errdil's inn so that Yennefer could help the injured bard.

As Yennefer worked on healing Dandelion, Geralt and Chireadan discussed the sorceress, with the two men both revealing in their own ways they found her attractive, though the elf noted that Geralt should be wary of Yennefer, as she didn't do things to help others unless she was also getting something out of it. After some time, Yennefer then called the witcher up to the room to see Dandelion only to then release a magical trap on Geralt and reveal she knew he had the seal. After some back-and-forth comments, Geralt gave it to her as a gesture of goodwill that he'd pay her for her help, however, this was fruitless as Yennefer had something else in mind and Geralt quickly deduced she wanted to use Dandelion, who had a connection to the djinn, to try and lure it back to capture it for herself. The witcher adamantly refused to put Dandelion in danger again, but by then Yennefer's other spells took hold, paralyzing the witcher and obscuring the room in a magical shield so nobody could interfere. With that, she then told Geralt he was going to pay for her help by settling some of her accounts in Rinde before violently kissing him, which placed a hypnotic spell on the witcher before he soon lost consciousness.

Geralt woke to find himself in the city's dungeons with Chireadan, who revealed in his mind-controlled state that Geralt had beat up the local pawnbroker and his apprentice, spanked the local apothecary [Laurelnose](/wiki/Laurelnose "Laurelnose"), took out a group of guards, then made his way to the temple while insulting the priest, [Krepp](/wiki/Krepp "Krepp"), as all 3 were on the town council and had voted to kick Yennefer out of Rinde while also spreading vulgar gossip about her. However, before Geralt could make it to the temple he fainted and the guards threw him into the dungeons, with Chireadan having been caught in the chaos and thrown in as well. Just then, several guards sent by Laurelnose came in and began to beat up Geralt, but when the one throwing the punches asked if the witcher had any wishes, Geralt stated he just had one: that the guard would burst and, before another punch could be thrown, the guard's body literally burst, killing him instantly.

With that, Geralt and Chireadan were brought before the mayor, [Neville](/wiki/Neville "Neville"), with Krepp also in attendance, with the latter noting it must have been the sorceress' work as neither the witcher nor elf had control of the [force](/wiki/Chaos "Chaos") to do so. After revealing almost the entire story to the mayor and priest, Krepp then concluded Yennefer wanted the djinn as it would give the sorceress a great deal of power and when the conversation turned to what Geralt said that made the genie run off, Geralt repeated the supposed exorcism only for Krepp to become insulted by it. Before more could be asked on this, Dandelion suddenly fell into the room through a portal, proclaiming Geralt was innocent and that Yennefer had ordered him to state before the mayor his wish was for them to believe the witcher wasn't guilty. Krepp quickly deduced it was the sorceress' way of using the last wish to free the genie so she could capture it when the group heard a thunderous noise outside of the building and looked out to see the djinn flying above Errdil's tavern, having been magically lassoed by Yennefer. However, the djinn wasn't going down without a fight and was destroying all the nearby buildings as it tried to break free.

Wishing to save Yennefer, Geralt got Krepp to cast a spell to re-open the portal Dandelion had come through but not before asking what the words of the exorcism he said earlier meant, to which Krepp paraphrased that it meant "get out of here and go fuck yourself!". With that, Geralt entered the portal and landed in Errdil's tavern where Yennefer was still trying to capture the genie while her powers waned. Seeing Geralt, she opened a portal to send him away as the djinn entered the tavern through its own portal to kill the sorceress, but Geralt threw himself between the two, shielding Yennefer. Shockingly, the genie didn't attack the witcher, but appeared to roar in an unknown language at him. Trying to get Yennefer away from it, Geralt pulled the sorceress through the portal she'd opened, though she yelled and threw punches at the witcher, claiming she almost had the genie, before rushing back through the portal with Geralt trying to grab her once more. As they crashed back in the tavern, Yennefer managed to cast a spell to pin the witcher down, but Geralt, trying to save her, informed her of the truth: he was the one making the wishes as he'd been the one holding the seal when he made his first wish (the "exorcism") and had one wish left.

As a weakened Yennefer demanded Geralt make his last wish so she could hopelessly try to capture the genie, Geralt finally realized what he wanted and that would also save Yennefer from the genie's wrath and wished their fates be tied, thus freeing the genie while preventing it from killing the sorceress. With that, the genie escaped back to its realm, and Geralt and Yennefer proceeded to make love in the destroyed tavern.[[3]](#cite_note-tlw-4)

### Staying in Vengerberg

After the events in Rinde, Yennefer and Geralt started a rather physical relationship, spending the majority of their time at Yennefer's home in [Vengerberg](/wiki/Vengerberg "Vengerberg"), [Aedirn](/wiki/Aedirn "Aedirn"), and putting to good use a wide variety of the sorceress' collection, including a stuffed [unicorn](/wiki/Unicorn_(creature) "Unicorn (creature)"), as well as having sex in rather unusual situations, like levitating 30 fathoms above the ground. However, the witcher finally decided to leave after half a year in the city, considering Yennefer's behavior as too possessive. Unable to initiate the parting though, the witcher ran off during the night, leaving only a rose and a letter on the bed as his farewell.

### Stolen swords

### The cursed princess

In [1252](/wiki/Timeline#1252 "Timeline"), Geralt traveled to [Vizima](/wiki/Vizima "Vizima") and visited [The Fox](/wiki/The_Fox "The Fox") but, while trying to find a bed to rent, was attacked by three racists who didn't approve of his Rivian accent. A short fight unfolded where Geralt killed the men but right after members of the [city guard](/wiki/City_Guard "City Guard") appeared and attempted to arrest him, though using [Axii](/wiki/Axii "Axii"), Geralt was able to manipulate them into taking him to [Velerad](/wiki/Velerad "Velerad"), the city castellan, instead.

Once he met Velerad, the pair took time discussing the real reason Geralt was passing through: King [Foltest](/wiki/Foltest "Foltest") of [Temeria](/wiki/Temeria "Temeria") had put out a contract to cure his daughter, [Adda the White](/wiki/Adda_the_White "Adda the White"), who was cursed and turned into a striga. After Geralt went and saw Foltest, they reached an agreement: for 3,000 [orens](/wiki/Oren "Oren"), Geralt would try to successfully release Adda from her curse, without killing her, as many had attempted in the past. The witcher then discussed the plan further with Foltest's underlings, [Ostrit](/wiki/Ostrit "Ostrit"), Velerad, and [Segelin](/wiki/Segelin "Segelin"), who agreed the witcher should spend a night in the old city with the striga.

Four days later, after talking to survivors of the beast, speaking further with Foltest, and finalizing plans, Geralt traveled to the old, abandoned palace and set up camp there, preparing his potions and meditating before he was found by Ostrit in the dead city. The magnate then tried to bribe the witcher with 1,000 orens to leave the place and never return, all while keeping the cursed Adda in her form. As Geralt questioned Ostrit's reasoning, noting a striga on the loose would make people lose faith in their king and possibly remove Foltest, the magnate grew frustrated and tried to fight the witcher, who quickly knocked out the man and tied him up.

Ostrit came to shortly after and soon realized Geralt planned to use him as bait to lure out Adda. He then confessed to the witcher he did want to overthrow Foltest, but more than that, he wanted the king to suffer because Foltest had taken the one Ostrit had loved, [Adda of Temeria](/wiki/Adda_of_Temeria "Adda of Temeria"), who was the king's own deceased sister and lover. However, he was adamant he couldn't have possibly caused the curse as he didn't know how to use magic and that Foltest and Adda's mother, [Sancia of Sodden](/wiki/Sancia_of_Sodden "Sancia of Sodden"), must have done it as she too didn't agree with the incestuous relationship. Geralt, however, heard the beast start to move out of her [crypt](/wiki/Striga%27s_crypt "Striga's crypt") and cut the magnate loose, who quickly took off to try and fruitlessly escape but was quickly killed by the striga.

Geralt and the striga then faced off against each other, though Geralt took care not to kill her, only looking to buy enough time to get her away from her crypt. Eventually managing to send her running, Geralt quickly hid himself in her tomb and closed it, casting [Yrden](/wiki/Yrden "Yrden") on the cover before meditating until dawn. Awaking a few hours later, right at dawn, he slipped out of the tomb to find Adda, now in human form, lying next to the tomb. However, as Geralt checked her teeth to make sure the transformation was complete, the still transforming girl awoke and slashed deep cuts in Geralt's neck with her talons. The witcher quickly pinned her down until she completely transformed back to human, but right after Geralt fainted from the blood loss.

Two days later, Geralt woke up in the new palace with Velerad looking after him, who explained they'd raced into the old palace right after dawn and found the badly injured witcher and saved him. Geralt then asked about the princess' condition and as the castellan explained she was fine, Geralt fell asleep once more.[[3]](#cite_note-tlw-4)

### Recovery in Ellander

After fighting and releasing the striga, Geralt traveled to [Ellander](/wiki/Ellander "Ellander") to recover at the Temple of Melitele. He was cared to by and quickly developed a relationship with one of the priestesses, [Iola](/wiki/Iola "Iola"), who was studying under Nenneke, and ended up sleeping with her, as she reminded him of Yennefer. The next morning, the two were awoken by Nenneke, who didn't want them in a relationship together, so she sent Iola out to continue with her duties. The older priestess had a look at Geralt's injuries and then after some assessment, sent the witcher to go eat breakfast, before joining him again in the temple gardens.

The two then discussed Iola using magic to put Geralt in a trance, and maybe reveal something about his destiny and future, though the witcher didn't want to undergo such a thing. Not long after that, Count [Falwick](/wiki/Falwick "Falwick") and [Arthur Tailles](/wiki/Arthur_Tailles "Arthur Tailles"), members of the [Order of the White Rose](/wiki/Order_of_the_White_Rose "Order of the White Rose"), arrived at the temple and confronted Geralt and Nenneke, asking the witcher to leave Ellander by the orders of Duke [Hereward](/wiki/Hereward "Hereward"). Tailles' attitude was met by Nenneke who declared the temple belonged to her and she decided who came and left, threatening the young knight with a small porcelain jar that was potentially harmful. Geralt decided to tell the men of his plans to leave Ellander in the next few days and adding insult to injury, started to insult Tailles, who furiously left the temple with his partner.

Geralt later went and saw Iola, explaining Kaer Morhen and his training as a witcher, as well as contracts he had taken throughout his life on [the path](/wiki/The_Path "The Path"). After spending some time alone and [reading](/wiki/The_History_of_the_World "The History of the World"), Geralt was informed by Nenneke that Dandelion was at the temple to visit him, just before the poet turned around the corner. The two discussed recent events and Dandelion's education before the witcher bought out vodka and they started to drink, with Geralt complaining about a lack of work in the area. After his drink with Dandelion, Geralt went to the [grotto](/wiki/Grotto "Grotto") in the garden and had a look at the many exotic herbs there while Nenneke harvested them. She asked him to stay a couple more days at the temple, which request was quickly turned down by the witcher, as he was preparing to leave that day.

After leaving the temple with Dandelion, the witcher started to ride towards the city of Ellander before he was confronted by Falwick, Tailles, and [Dennis Cranmer](/wiki/Dennis_Cranmer "Dennis Cranmer"), with Falwick declaring the young knight and the witcher must fight, as Tailles' pride had been injured at the temple. Falwick then informed Geralt that he had to throw the fight, as hitting the knight would have him arrested and thrown in front of Hereward. Geralt agreed to the fight and easily outmanoeuvred the young knight, making him hit himself in the face, which Falwick believed was worth Cranmer arresting Geralt according to his orders, but the dwarf believed that Tailles had hit himself and that wasn't worth arresting the witcher for. As Geralt prepared to leave, he threatened Falwick, saying if he ever threatened Nenneke or Cranmer again, he would die for it.

The two headed back to the temple, where he prepared to travel, packing up his horse and saying his goodbyes. Iola came out and gave him his elixirs and after their hands touched, she started to suffer a seizure, which Nenneke told Geralt to ignore and leave, which he did.[[3]](#cite_note-tlw-4)

### Dragon hunt

TBA

### Aedd Gynvael

A while later, Geralt and Yennefer traveled to the city of [Aedd Gynvael](/wiki/Aedd_Gynvael "Aedd Gynvael") in [Narok](/wiki/Narok "Narok"), and during their stay in the city, Geralt took on a contract on a nasty [zeugl](/wiki/Zeugl "Zeugl") that had infested the sewers. While fighting the beast, he got stuck in a rubbish heap and was dragged through the filth, and after striking the killing blow, the beast's slime and bile spilled all over the witcher, adding to his stench.

After returning to the [inn](/wiki/The_Sturgeon "The Sturgeon") they were staying at, Yennefer made a deal of Geralt's smell and instantly made him bathe in seawater, while they discussed his fight with the zeugl. They then discussed the mage [Istredd](/wiki/Istredd "Istredd"), a topic of jealousy for Geralt, and after discussing their plans in the city, they made love.[[6]](#cite_note-sod-7)

### Meeting Triss

At some point, Geralt met the young sorceress [Triss Merigold](/wiki/Triss_Merigold "Triss Merigold"), a close friend of Yennefer's during their on-again-off again relationship. After a recent breakup, when Geralt was left feeling vulnerable and wanted to forget about her, Triss used a little bit of magic to seduce the witcher and the two began a short-lived relationship. However, after some time, Geralt chose to end the relationship out of guilt. The separation was difficult for Triss as she had fallen deeply in love with him. Despite this, the two remained good friends even though Triss was still unhappily in love with him, he did not wish to start anew.[[7]](#cite_note-boe-8)

### Law of Surprise

TBA

### Meeting Ciri

In [1263](/wiki/Timeline#1263 "Timeline"), Geralt travelled to the [Brokilon](/wiki/Brokilon "Brokilon") forest where he happened across a young princess named Ciri, although Geralt was unaware of who she truly was. The dryads wished to keep her and attempt to turn her into one of their own, however, the Waters of Oblivion failed in her case. Geralt and Ciri managed to leave the forest together and he sent her back to her grandmother, Queen [Calanthe](/wiki/Calanthe "Calanthe"). However, Geralt had already begun to feel bound to her.[[6]](#cite_note-sod-7)

### Training Ciri at Kaer Morhen

In early [1265](/wiki/Timeline#1265 "Timeline"), after escaping the forests, Geralt and Ciri rode north to the safety of Kaer Morhen. After tying up Roach, and introducing Ciri to Eskel, Geralt went into the keep with the two and caught up with Lambert, [Coën](/wiki/Co%C3%ABn "Coën"), and Vesemir, where they all agreed to start training the young girl.

In December, after spending a while training Ciri, mainly in the ways of combat, Geralt called for Triss Merigold to help her, as Ciri was displaying signs of a high magical aura. After Triss spent time with Ciri, she became disgusted at the bruises and welts all over her body from training, as well as the witcher's ignorance to her first period, which she had been told earlier in life not to tell men about. One night, while all in the keep had dinner and [White Seagull](/wiki/White_Seagull "White Seagull"), Triss sent Ciri into a trance, in an attempt to reveal what was causing the constant trances, against the wishes of Geralt, and ended up passing out. The next morning, she woke in the bed with Geralt and recommended they take Ciri to the Temple of Melitele in Ellander on the first day of spring, and seek out Yennefer's help in training her.

One night in the middle of February [1266](/wiki/Timeline#1266 "Timeline") though, Geralt and the witchers were conversing with Triss in regards to their indifference to politics and went into detail about what happened during the [Battle of Sodden Hill](/wiki/Battle_of_Sodden_Hill "Battle of Sodden Hill"). Ciri ran into the room, proclaiming she'd stand by Triss in fighting the Nilfgaardians as they'd killed her grandmother; Ciri revealed she thought she was training to kill, as she wanted to kill the winged helmet knight that haunted her dreams. Geralt sharply chastised her, informing her they were training her to save lives, not to kill out of fear and hatred, before sending her out of the room.

Distraught, Ciri ran out into the courtyard and stopped on the ledge of one of the walls where she inspected her sword. As Geralt and Triss approached, she cried out that nobody was going to take her sword from her, but as she moved, she lost her footing and almost fell to her death but Geralt caught her in the nick of time. After speaking comforting words to Ciri, the three agreed it was time to head south to the temple in Ellander.[[7]](#cite_note-boe-8)

### Road to the temple

After they left the keep, Triss, Geralt, and Ciri travelled south through Kaedwen, passing over the [Gwenllech](/wiki/Gwenllech "Gwenllech") and [Buina](/wiki/Buina "Buina") rivers, and eventually passing the capital, [Ard Carraigh](/wiki/Ard_Carraigh "Ard Carraigh"). Along the way, Triss grew quite ill in her saddle and was unable to travel for longer periods than an hour or two at a time, with her condition steadily getting worse.

Eventually, the three came across a fortress and bridge that had been recently attacked by [Scoia'tael](/wiki/Scoia%27tael "Scoia'tael"), and met with the Kaedwenian sergeant [Unist](/wiki/Unist "Unist") stationed there. The man offered Triss a bed, hoping if she felt better, she may be able to magically heal his soldiers, while Geralt spoke of the Scoia'tael with Unist and a knight. They told him he would not find help at the fort, and to head south over the river and find a caravan in the woods that might have supplies. In the night Geralt came to the caravan and found [Yarpen Zigrin](/wiki/Yarpen_Zigrin "Yarpen Zigrin") and his [company](/wiki/Yarpen_Zigrin%27s_company "Yarpen Zigrin's company"), who helped Triss by giving her garlic-salt bread, which he considered medicine. Geralt asked if they could join the company on the ten-day march south to the [Lixela](/wiki/Lixela "Lixela"), as Triss could rest on the dwarves' cart. After Yarpen discussed it with [Vilfrid Wenck](/wiki/Vilfrid_Wenck "Vilfrid Wenck"), they agreed to start going south with the three.

Over several days of travel, Triss' sickness didn't get better and at one point they were stopped by a [Dun Banner](/wiki/Dun_Banner "Dun Banner") patrol, led by [Zyvik](/wiki/Zyvik "Zyvik"), who warned them of Scoia'tael in the woods. One afternoon Ciri decided to run off ahead, followed by Geralt. He found her hiding in the bushes, spotting a Scoia'tael warrior across a ravine. He decided they should not tell the group, as to remain neutral, and leave with Ciri the next morning. While walking back, they passed through [Shaerrawedd](/wiki/Shaerrawedd "Shaerrawedd"), an ancient elven palace, and Geralt told Ciri the story of [Aelirenn](/wiki/Aelirenn "Aelirenn"). Suddenly Ciri sensed the group was in danger, so they galloped back to find the Scoia'tael attacking the company. After a short fight, and the deaths of [Yannick Brass](/wiki/Yannick_Brass "Yannick Brass") and [Paulie Dahlberg](/wiki/Paulie_Dahlberg "Paulie Dahlberg"), another Dun Banner patrol rode in and slaughtered the elves. Vilfrid had been stabbed in the skirmish, and so died on the ground in front of Geralt. The patrol revealed orders had forced the company into a trap, set up by Henselt to test the dwarves' loyalty to the Scoia'tael. After that, the company kept heading south and Triss, Geralt, and Ciri eventually reached the temple with no further issues.[[7]](#cite_note-boe-8)

### Guarding the barge

In [1266](/wiki/Timeline#1266 "Timeline"), while Ciri was training at the Temple of Melitele in Ellander, Geralt left to look for work and took on a contract issued by the [Malatius and Grock Company](/wiki/Malatius_and_Grock_Company "Malatius and Grock Company") to guard the barge passing on the [Pontar Delta](/wiki/Pontar_Delta "Pontar Delta") between [Foam](/wiki/Foam "Foam") and Novigrad, in an attempt to lure out the mage [Rience](/wiki/Rience "Rience"). On six different occasions, the trip went successfully, until one day when he was talking to a young boy [Everett](/wiki/Everett "Everett"). After finishing his conversation he met [Linus Pitt](/wiki/Linus_Pitt "Linus Pitt"), a tutor at the [Oxenfurt Academy](/wiki/Oxenfurt_Academy "Oxenfurt Academy"), and they discussed the local wildlife. As the boat neared the banks of Oxenfurt, Temerian guards on the shore called out for the arrest of Geralt for harboring Ciri, as Rience had put out a reward for their capture. [Olsen](/wiki/Olsen "Olsen") stated Ciri was not aboard and lied about Geralt, telling the guards he was bound for trial in Oxenfurt. One of the guards swiftly grabbed Everett and held a cutlass to his throat, bargaining the young boy's life for Geralt's, who called out his surrender. As he went to leave the barge, the whole group was attacked by an aeschna, which started slaughtering the guards. After saving Everett from the creature, Geralt boarded the barge and watched the remaining guards die to arrowfire from the barge or be eaten by the creature. The barge then set sail to continue to Oxenfurt, where Geralt departed.[[7]](#cite_note-boe-8)

### Dealing with Rience

In [1267](/wiki/Timeline#1267 "Timeline"), after arriving in Oxenfurt and meeting up with Dandelion, Geralt took shelter in the attic of [Wolfgang Amadeus Goatbeard](/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Goatbeard "Wolfgang Amadeus Goatbeard"), a brewer friend of Dandelion's. After the young medical student [Shani](/wiki/Shani "Shani") delivered a message to the witcher from Dandelion, she had sex with him in the attic bed, which was later interrupted by the bard visiting the attic himself. Dandelion explained [Sigismund Dijkstra](/wiki/Sigismund_Dijkstra "Sigismund Dijkstra") wasn't as interested in Verden, Rience, or Geralt, his true intentions lay with Ciri's location. Realizing their danger, Geralt prepared to depart at once, and as they went to climb through the attic window, [Philippa Eilhart](/wiki/Philippa_Eilhart "Philippa Eilhart") flew down in owl form to the roof, and after being revealed, [polymorphed](/wiki/Polymorphy "Polymorphy") into her true form. They all started a discussion revealing to Geralt it was King [Vizimir II](/wiki/Vizimir_II "Vizimir II") who had ordered Dijkstra to find Ciri, and that she held great importance, with the [Council of Wizards](/wiki/Council_of_Wizards "Council of Wizards"), Dijkstra, Vizimir, the Temerians, and Rience all hunting her. With that, Shani asked if Rience had a burn on his face, and after confirmation, revealed she knew him and where he was. With everyone looking at her in wonderment, Shani explained that tuition was too costly for her stepfather to cover all of it so she'd been stealing supplies from the school and selling on the side to a local named [Myhrman](/wiki/Myhrman "Myhrman"). One day when conducting such business, Myhrman had been entertaining a guest he called "Master Rience" with a burn mark on his face and who'd made unwanted advances at Shani before Myhrman told him to cut it out, as he still wanted to do business with the medical student. With this new information, the group asked Shani to take them to the local, who was now Geralt's best lead in finding Rience.

That night they went to Myhrman's fortified house in the [docks](/wiki/Oxenfurt_Harbor "Oxenfurt Harbor"), and Shani drew him out pretending to be alone. After Myhrman let down the drawbridge, Geralt appeared from the shadows and punched him in the side of the head, rendering him unconscious and able to be tied up for interrogation. The witcher and Shani told him they knew about his relations with Rience, but Philippa grew tired of the merchant's deceit and started to torture him for information. Through his screams, Geralt obtained the location of a magic amulet he used to summon Rience.

As dawn approached, Geralt wandered the streets of Oxenfurt, having used the amulet and swallowed a witcher potion in preparation for finding Rience. He reached an alleyway near Myhrman's house where he heard four men, and then saw Rience walk into the light. After a quick conversion, the four men, the [Michelet brothers](/wiki/Michelet_brothers "Michelet brothers"), came out of the alleyway and attacked Geralt. With the use of pirouettes and speed, the witcher fought off the constant attacks, and killed them one-by-one, noticing Rience retreat back into the alley. As Rience continued to flee, Geralt ran after him and just stopped the mage's escape by portal, knocking him down. As the two began to fistfight, Rience grew weary and as Geralt went to stab him, Philippa appeared and held the witcher magically down, allowing Rience to escape through the portal. While Philippa claimed to have not betrayed them, that she had much larger plans for Rience, Geralt told her that every day he lived was a day she was supporting death.[[7]](#cite_note-boe-8)

### Hirundum

In June, after Rience escaped his grasp, Geralt and Dandelion returned to Temeria and the witcher completed a contract on a fogler near [Carreras](/wiki/Carreras "Carreras"), and a werewolf near [Burdorff](/wiki/Burdorff "Burdorff"), rewarding him 50 crowns a contract. He was later asked by villagers to help them with a different monster problem. After a quick assessment, Geralt deduced it was an uncommon great manticore, and demanded 200 [crowns](/wiki/Crown "Crown") for the contract. The townsman considered this too high a price, but the witcher made clear the danger leaving the manticore would entail, and so before he could back out, the merchants paid up. After quickly taking out his sword, Geralt slew the beast, with quick strokes and signs, much to the townspeoples' surprise and awe. He then took his lower payment of 150 crowns and rode from the crossroads to the local town [Dorian](/wiki/Dorian "Dorian") for night's rest.

In the morning, he visited the offices of [Codringher and Fenn](/wiki/Codringher_and_Fenn "Codringher and Fenn"), a lawyer duo Geralt knew. At first, [Codringher](/wiki/Codringher "Codringher") provided information about Rience at the price of 250 crowns, and then introduced Geralt to [Jacob Fenn](/wiki/Jacob_Fenn "Jacob Fenn"), who had been studying the implications the rulers and Rience searching for Ciri held, and the origins of her father. Before leaving the offices, Codringher also suggested Geralt and Ciri hide away in Kaer Morhen, and provide a [false Ciri](/wiki/Cirilla_Fiona_(imposter) "Cirilla Fiona (imposter)") in her place, though the witcher objected. Taking an 100 crown loan out, Geralt prepared to leave for [Anchor](/wiki/Anchor "Anchor"), as the detective had also heard news of three assassins chasing Yennefer and Ciri along the road to the town. In Anchor, at the local inn, he met the messenger [Aplegatt](/wiki/Aplegatt "Aplegatt") and told him to hide as he knew the assassins were near. Eventually, [Ralf Blunden](/wiki/Ralf_Blunden "Ralf Blunden"), [Little Yaxa](/wiki/Little_Yaxa "Little Yaxa"), and [Heimo Kantor](/wiki/Heimo_Kantor "Heimo Kantor"), the three assassins, were confronted and killed by Geralt outside the inn.[[8]](#cite_note-toc-9)

A few days later, he and Dandelion went to the village of [Little Marsh](/wiki/Little_Marsh "Little Marsh"), and then onto [Hirundum](/wiki/Hirundum "Hirundum"), the [Hofmeier family](/wiki/Hofmeier_family "Hofmeier family") farm. Geralt's old friend [Bernie](/wiki/Bernie_Hofmeier "Bernie Hofmeier") had posted a notice for a witcher to investigate the recent drowning of a young boy in one of the farm's ponds, and Geralt knew it would be an opportune location to stay close to [Thanedd Island](/wiki/Thanedd_Island "Thanedd Island") where Ciri was to study. One stormy night, as he returned from a quick investigation, Ciri arrived at the farm on horseback, with Yennefer chasing via portal. Their first meeting in years, Geralt and the sorceress spent the following morning discussing her plans for all four of them to attend the [Grand Mage's Conclave](/wiki/Thanedd_coup "Thanedd coup") on Thanedd.[[8]](#cite_note-toc-9)

### Thanedd coup

The following day, on the 30th, they rode to Thanedd, specifically to the palace [Loxia](/wiki/Loxia "Loxia"), where they attended the reception and met everybody. Come evening, Geralt and Yennefer went with the other mages to [Aretuza](/wiki/Aretuza "Aretuza"), and while Yennefer met up with friends, Geralt spoke to Sabrina Glevissig, Triss, [Keira Metz](/wiki/Keira_Metz "Keira Metz"), Philippa Eilhart, Dijsktra, [Dorregaray](/wiki/Dorregaray "Dorregaray") and [Marti Södergren](/wiki/Marti_S%C3%B6dergren "Marti Södergren") throughout the banquet. Finally, he was approached by [Vilgefortz](/wiki/Vilgefortz "Vilgefortz") and [Lydia van Bredevoort](/wiki/Lydia_van_Bredevoort "Lydia van Bredevoort"), who took him on a tour of the [Gallery of Glory](/wiki/Gallery_of_Glory "Gallery of Glory"), and after Lydia left, Vilfefortz offered a truce; join the traitors and live free, though Geralt refused. After returning to the banquet, Geralt and Yennefer said their goodnights and went to bed.

In the early hours of the morning, Geralt awoke and began walking through the garden, only to sense magic and the sounds of battle. He discovered several Redanian soldiers led by Dijkstra, who arrested him in case he defended the Nilfgaardian traitors while Keira arrested [Artaud Terranova](/wiki/Artaud_Terranova "Artaud Terranova"). She used a spell to temporarily blind the witcher, and he was led to Philippa, who was leading the Northern allies. Though later, after sending the traitors to [Garstang](/wiki/Garstang "Garstang") to face trial, she restored his eyesight. Geralt was escorted by Dijkstra, who revealed he planned to capture Ciri and use her as a pawn for King Vizimir. Geralt fought off Dijkstra and his guards and Dandelion arrived to inform him that Ciri was gone. As Geralt made his way through Garstang, he could hear sounds and see signs of a battle occurring and encountered a few mages who told him that the magical barrier around the island had been lowered, and rival mages were attacking one another, along with Scoia'tael aligned with Nilfgaard. In the chaos, he found Ciri, who was in the grasp of the mage, Artaud Terranova, but he was attacked by Philippa and Geralt decapitated the mage, rescuing Ciri. He got her on horseback to flee, but she was pursued by Cahir, with Scoia'tael. He followed behind, killing the elves and seeing Cahir already helpless after fighting Ciri, who had fled prior. Geralt asked why he should spare him, and the knight told Geralt he rescued Ciri from the Slaughter of Cintra, and Geralt chose to leave the knight alive. Geralt soon found himself confronting Vilgefortz, and the mage easily beat Geralt down, nearly killing him, but choosing the spare the witcher. Geralt was found by Triss who tried to help him but was weak from the fighting. Tissaia chose to help Triss, teleporting Triss and Geralt away from the island.[[8]](#cite_note-toc-9)

### Healing in Brokilon

Triss brought the witcher to the healing spa [Col Serrai](/wiki/Col_Serrai "Col Serrai") in Brokilon to recover from his injuries, and left him to heal. By August, Geralt was visited by Dandelion, who updated him of the events of the [war](/wiki/Northern_War_II "Northern War II"), and so the two decided to travel to [Brugge](/wiki/Brugge "Brugge"), where the bard had heard rumours mentioning the girl. Before leaving though, after 36 days in the forest, Geralt saw [Milva](/wiki/Milva "Milva") who told him of the news of Ciri being in Nilfgaard (not knowing that it was a false Cirilla), and that the emperor may be planning to marry her. Upon hearing this, the witcher decided to head for Nilfgaard.[[8]](#cite_note-toc-9)

### On the road

Geralt and Dandelion began their journey south following the [Ribbon](/wiki/Ribbon "Ribbon") river to the [Ceann Treise](/wiki/Ceann_Treise "Ceann Treise") falls, where they planned their march to [Verden](/wiki/Verden "Verden"), and then further onto Cintra along the [Yaruga](/wiki/Yaruga "Yaruga"). As they set off and a heavy storm hit, they were surprised by two [havekars](/wiki/Havekar "Havekar"), [Kolda](/wiki/Kolda "Kolda") and his boss, though were quickly let go due to the traders mistaking the pair for elves because of their Brokilonian clothes. As they went to leave, however, [Imperial agents](/wiki/Nilfgaardian_Military_Intelligence "Nilfgaardian Military Intelligence") arrived to grab the havekar's tied-up prisoner: Cahir aep Ceallach. While first furious at the belief the traders had killed Cahir, due to him being tied up in a coffin, the meeting then turned into a mutiny when the Imperials attacked their so-called "allies". Milva then arrived, having been following Geralt's trail, and helped the witcher kill the remaining Imperials. Spotting the coffin again, the group opened it and untied Cahir, and upon Geralt's first unveiling and near-distain of the [Vicovarian](/wiki/Vicovaro "Vicovaro"), they ambivalently decided to spare only his life, untie him, and leave him there to fend for himself, being the second time the knight received mercy from the witcher, though he was warned of his doom should they meet again.

Despite Geralt's warning, Cahir took off after the group, though he never directly approached them. It was only several days later when the group, fed up with knowing someone was following them but not sure who, confronted them only to find Cahir once again in their presence. As Geralt demanded Cahir fight him, the knight stated he didn't wish to fight but to join them in rescuing Ciri. Geralt strongly objected to this, threatening to kill him once more but Cahir, unwillingly to pull out his weapon like Geralt demanded, reiterated that he didn't want to fight, leaving the two in a stalemate. Only when Milva stated she could put an arrow in his horse to prevent Cahir from catching up with them as they continued on did Cahir mount and run off.

Eventually, while travelling through the forest, they came across the dwarf [Zoltan Chivay](/wiki/Zoltan_Chivay "Zoltan Chivay") and [his company](/wiki/Zoltan_Chivay%27s_company "Zoltan Chivay's company"). The dwarves told them of their plan to travel to the [Turlough Hills](/wiki/Turlough_Hills "Turlough Hills"), then the [Old Road](/wiki/Old_Road "Old Road") to the river [Chotla](/wiki/Chotla "Chotla") in [Sodden](/wiki/Sodden "Sodden"), before continuing onto the [Ina](/wiki/Ina "Ina"). Zoltan, after hearing of the three wanderers journey south toward enemy clutches, invited them to join the dwarves on their march east, which was accepted.[[2]](#cite_note-bof-3)

### Meeting Regis

Geralt and his company continued the journey alongside Zoltan's company, quickly making friends with the amicable dwarves. On the road they witnessed numerous attrocities and were forced into difficult situations, such as when dispatched a group of bandits that have taken over a plague-infested village and murdered it's inhabitants.

Eventually, the company reached an ancient elven cemetery named [Fen Carn](/wiki/Fen_Carn "Fen Carn"). There, they met the peculiar man who introduced himself as [Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy](/wiki/Emiel_Regis_Rohellec_Terzieff-Godefroy "Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy"), a barber-surgeon from [Dillingen](/wiki/Dillingen "Dillingen") who spends summer in his small cottage at the cemetery. Regis invated the company to his cottage and treated them with his self-made [mandrake](/wiki/Mandrake "Mandrake") moonshine, causing most of the companions to quickly become very drunk. The next day Regis decided to join the company, claiming that their arrival made him aware that war was closer than he thought and it wasn't safe to stay in Fen Carn anymore.

Soon, the company reached a refugee camp at [Chotla](/wiki/Chotla "Chotla") river. There, the group saw a supposed priest condemning a mentally challenged woman, claiming she was a [witch](/wiki/Mage "Mage") and in cahoots with the supposed [vampire](/wiki/Vampire "Vampire") in the area. Realizing she was just a scapegoat, Geralt, Zoltan, and Milva stated they'd do a trial of ordeal in their specialties, but the priest demanded instead an impossible trial to prove theirs and the woman's innocence: to remove one of the horseshoes out of the fire and bring it over to the priest and, if they bore no burn marks, they were innocent. Before they could figure out a plan, Regis strode forward, removed one and calmly held it out, revealing no burn marks. However the priest began to claim it was black magic.

Before anything else could happen though, an alarm was cried that Nilfgaardian troops were approaching and everyone scattered. The camp soon becamethe sight of a battle between the Nilfgaardian army and a unit of Cintran refugees led by [Marshal Vissegerd](/wiki/Vissegerd "Vissegerd"). Milva, Regis and the dwarves managed to escape, but Geralt and Dandelion were captured by the Cintrans and taken to their camp.

In the Cintran camp near the fort of Ameria, the duo comes face to fave with Vissegerd. While Dandelion is hopeful that they will soon be released he is soon proven incorrect, as the vengeful Visegered, who has to deal with a wave of desertions following the news that [Emhyr](/wiki/Emhyr_var_Emreis "Emhyr var Emreis") plans to marry [Princess Cirilla](/wiki/Cirilla_Fiona_(imposter) "Cirilla Fiona (imposter)"), blames Geralt for the marriage between [Duny](/wiki/Emhyr_var_Emreis "Emhyr var Emreis") and [Princess Pavetta](/wiki/Pavetta "Pavetta"), which resulted in Ciri's birth. He then orders Geralt and Dandelion to be hanged the next morning for espionage.

Geralt, imprisoned and tied up, resigns to his fate. The night before his execution however, Geralt and Dandelion are unexpectedly freed by Regis, who has inexplicably managed to enter the camp undetected. Before they have a chance to talk Regis once again, inexplicalby, dissapears.

While sneaking out of the camp, Geralt and Dandelion were once again caught between a hammer and an anvil, as the Cintran camp was being attacked by Nilfgaardian cavalry. The duo managed to escape on horseback, with Dandelion sustaining a minor injury to his head (although he reacted as if he was mortally wounded).

Geralt and Dandelion are soon reunited with Milva who reveals that she has made common cause with Cahir, who has saved her from some vengeful peasants. Regis appears once again and treats Dandelion's wound. Geralt reveals that he has deduced the truth, that Regis is in fact a [higher vampire](/wiki/Higher_Vampire "Higher Vampire"), and orders him to leave the company and never come back, or else he will be forced to kill him. Regis soon does so, but that very same day when the company makes camp on the bank of the [Yaruga](/wiki/Yaruga "Yaruga") he returns. Geralt is furious, but the other companions, including Cahir, defend Regis and argue that, would he want to kill them and drink their blood, he would have done so already, and so far he has proven himself to be nothing but helpful. Geralt, after a lot of sulking, at last agrees to let both Regis and Cahir join him in his quest. And so, on the bank of Yaruga, the Witcher's Company is formed.

### Looking for the druids

Since both Geralt and Cahir had been having nightmares that suggested that Ciri was not, in fact, in Nilfgaard, Regis adivses Geralt to search for the druids of Caed Dhu, with the leader of whom Regis was in friendly relations, so that they might use their magic to help him locate Ciri. The company thus once again sets forth towards Sodden. To reach that region however they have to cross the Yaruga, which is not at all easy during wartime. The company decides to go through Ysgith, a highly dangerous swamp region of Angren. On their way they once again chance upon Zoltan and his company and, before parting ways once again, Zoltan gifts Geralt his beautiful dwarven sword "[Sihil](/wiki/Sihil "Sihil")". The company soon discoveres that Milva is pregnant, and Geralt decides to abandon the plan to pass through Ysgith, knowing it might be too dangerous for Milva. Instead, the company decides to cross the Yaruga.

The company commandeeres a ferry to cross the Yaruga, but as they cross, they find themselves in the middle of two opposing forces of the [Lyrian](/wiki/Lyrian-Rivian_Army "Lyrian-Rivian Army") and Nilfgaardian armies. While fleeing both forces, the ferry lands on the bridge connecting the two shores. Milva, struck by an arrow, miscarries and Regis has to tend to her, so Geralt and Cahir rush to protect their friend and decide to take up arms against the Nilfgaardians, both fighting the forces and inspiring the Lyrians to combat the foe, defeating the enemy. Despite his lack of interest in political matters, Geralt was brought to Queen [Meve](/wiki/Meve "Meve"), who knighted him, properly granting him the title of Geralt of Rivia for his role in the battle.

Geralt and his company remained in Queen Meve's army for several days healing from their injuries sustained during the battle. When Geralt asked the Queen for permission to leave and continue his quest, Meve angerly refused, reminding Geralt that he was now sworn to her as a knight. Subsequently, Geralt and his company sneaked out of the Lyrian camp at night, stealing some supplies along the way.

### Nightingale

They then make their way to the town of [Riedbrune](/wiki/Riedbrune "Riedbrune") in the Slopes. There, Geralt is promptly arrested by order of the local prefect [Fulko Alteverde](/wiki/Fulko_Artevelde "Fulko Artevelde"). During an audience in the prefect's office, Geralt meets [Angoulême](/wiki/Angoul%C3%AAme "Angoulême"), a young outlaw and former member of the [Nightingale gang](/wiki/Nightingale_gang "Nightingale gang"). Angoulême had left the gang and surrendered herself to the prefect, hoping to trade information about the gang's plans for amnesty. Geralt then learns that the gang's boss [Homer Straggen](/wiki/Homer_Straggen "Homer Straggen") (also known as Nightingale) was contracted by a mysterious half-elf to kill Geralt and his three companions, and has prepared an ambush in the town of [Belhaven](/wiki/Belhaven "Belhaven"). Geralt is forced by the prefect to agree to kill Nightingale and his gang. Learning that, despite her defection, Alteverde still plans to have Angoulême executed, Geralt demands that she be released to him before agreeing to the deal. The prefect agrees, and Angoulême thus becomes the fifth member of Geralt's company.

The company continues their journey towards Belhaven. However, tensions rise on the way as Geralt, knowing that Straggen was contracted to kill Geralt and three of his companions (which means that one person from his present company was not included), begins to suspect Cahir of treason. The tensions result in a brutal fistfight between the witcher and the Nilfgaardian, which is only stopped after Milva beats both men into submission with her belt. Subsequently, the group concludes that the group must have been located by means of magical localising. The missing person is determined to be Regis who, as a [vampire](/wiki/Vampire "Vampire"), could not be located magically. Geralt apologises to Cahir and concludes that, as the technique of magical localising requires strong emotional connection between the mage and the target, that he must have been betrayed by Yennefer, as she is the only mage that is close enough to him that could have achieved such a feat (Yennefer was indeed the one that located Geralt and his company, but was forced to do it against her will under torture by Vilgefortz).

The company then decides to split. Geralt, Cahir and Angoulême continue on their way to Belhaven to confront Nightingale and attempt to learn who the mysterious half-elf is, while Regis, Milva and Dandelion continue towards [Toussaint](/wiki/Toussaint "Toussaint") to find the druids. Geralt and his companions reach Belhaven and confront Stagger, but are quickly apprehended by the half-elf [Schirrú](/wiki/Schirr%C3%BA "Schirrú") and a unit of corrupt Nilgaardian soldiers. They are saved from certain death by a sudden attack by members of the [Free Slopes](/wiki/Free_Slopes "Free Slopes"), an organisation of anti-Nilfgaardian partisans. The trio manage to escape into the mountains, but Cahir sustains a seve injury to his head. Knowing that the Nilfgaardian is in no condition to flee, Geralt instructs Angoulême to run to Toussaint and inform the rest of the company of the events. Geralt and Cahir meanwhile find shelter in a mountain cave, where they hide from Schirrú and Nightingale's men, who continue to pursue Angoulême. During the night, Geralt has an honest conversation with Cahir, and learns of his gentle treatment of Ciri during the [Slaughter of Cintra](/wiki/Slaughter_of_Cintra "Slaughter of Cintra") and his love for the girl. The next day, Geralt and injured Cahir continue on their way towards Toussaint.

Geralt and Cahir meet Regis underneath [Mount Gorgon](/wiki/Mount_Gorgon "Mount Gorgon"). The vampire informs them that the Druids are already aware of Geralt and his quest and have sent him forth to meet the Witcher and instruct him to enter a cave underneath the mountain to meet someone important. Inside, Geralt, after being harrased by a number of strange monsters, meets [Avallac'h](/wiki/Avallac%27h "Avallac'h"), an Elf Mage. Avallac'h implores Geralt to abandon his search for Ciri, as he claims she is already destined for greater things. Geralt refuses, and asks Avallac'h to grant him a vision of Ciri which would confirm that she is indeed alive. The Elf agrees but, instead of Ciri, Geralt sees his companions in mortal danger, being attacked by Schirrú and Nightingale's men. Geralt, with the help of a mysterious intelligent monster, quickly transports himself to Toussaint, leaving Cahir with Regis, and fights the pursuers with the help of Toussaint's knights errant. Schirrú, Nightingale and their men are eventually defeated by the druids and their massive Tree monster, which captures all of them and places them in a massive wicker ball. The druids, as punishment for breaking in and defiling the Druid's sacred garden, burn Schirrú, Stagger and all of their men alive. Geralt, who have failed to interrogate Schirrú to learn the identity of his benefactor and the whereabouts of Ciri, is left distraught.

### In Toussaint

After the the fight in [Caed Myrkvid](/wiki/Caed_Myrkvid "Caed Myrkvid"), Geralt and his company are escorted to [Beauclair](/wiki/Beauclair "Beauclair"), the capital of Toussaint, where they are greeted by [Anna Henrietta](/wiki/Anna_Henrietta "Anna Henrietta"), the Duchess of Toussaint. Geralt wants to leave immediately and continue the quest, but this is contrary to the wishes of his companions, who wish to rest in the fairytale-like Duchy for a while after their gruelling, long journey. Additionally, the heavy snowfall has made the passages out of the Duchy almost impassable, and even if the company could somehow make their way through them, after the death of Schirrú they have no leads to pursue.

Geralt is distraught and angry at himself and at his companions, but eventually he too finds the reason to stay in the Duchy. Believing that Yennefer has betrayed him to Vilgefortz, Geralt starts a relationship with the Nilfaagrdian sorceress and Anna Henrietta's cousin [Fringilla Vigo](/wiki/Fringilla_Vigo "Fringilla Vigo"). Unbeknownst to Geralt, Fringilla is a member of the [Lodge of Sorceresses](/wiki/Lodge_of_Sorceresses "Lodge of Sorceresses"), and has been instructed to spy on Geralt and keep him in Toussaint as long as possible, as the Lodge had their own designs for Ciri.

Geralt and his company spent the winter of 1267-68 in the comfort of the Duchy of Toussaint. Geralt, apart from spending time with Fringilla, returns to his customary witcher work, hunting monsters that inhabit the many ancient tunnels, caves and dungeouns in the Duchy. However, as months pass, Geralt's companions, who have previously insisted on staying in the Duchy, begin to grow restless and tired of wasting time in Toussaint, believing that Geralt has lost interest in his quest. Indeed, the Witcher, manipulated by Fringilla, has wasted time and delayed his departure from the Duchy.

This changed when, during a routine hunt for monsters inhabiting the caves beneath the [Zurbarràn](/wiki/Zurbarr%C3%A0n "Zurbarràn") castle, Geralt accidentally overhears [Stefan Skellen](/wiki/Stefan_Skellen "Stefan Skellen") conspiring with Nilfgaard's powerful, discontent nobles. Geralt learns that Vilgefortz is hiding in [Stygga Castle](/wiki/Stygga_Castle "Stygga Castle") in [Ebbing](/wiki/Ebbing "Ebbing"). Finally finding a lead he had been long looking for, Geralt immediately decides to leave Toussaint, even though the snows had not yet melted. All of his companions are eager to join him, except for Dandelion, who had restarted his relationship with Duchess Anna Henrietta. He and Geralt part on amicable terms, and before he leaves Geralt asks him to deliver a letter to [Sigismund Dijkstra](/wiki/Sigismund_Dijkstra "Sigismund Dijkstra"). Before he leaves, Geralt also has one last meeting with Fringilla during which, having realised that Fringilla had manipulated him and kept him in Toussaint on purpose, he informs her that Vilgefortz is located in [Rhys-Rhun Castle](/wiki/Rhys-Rhun_Castle "Rhys-Rhun Castle"). This disinformation causes massive embarrasment to the fldedling Lodge of Sorceresses, most of all it's leader [Philippa Eilhart](/wiki/Philippa_Eilhart "Philippa Eilhart"), and to Fringilla personally.

### Stygga Castle

Having broken through the snow-covered mountain passages, Geralt and his companions race towards Stygga Castle. They arrive and [storm the castle](/wiki/Assault_on_Stygga_castle "Assault on Stygga castle") just as Ciri, who had arrived to the castle to free Yennefer, is about to be tortured and experimented on by Vilgefortz. The fighting is brutal and costs the lives of all of Geralt's companions. Milva is killed by crossbowmen, Cahir dies defending Ciri from [Leo Bonhart](/wiki/Leo_Bonhart "Leo Bonhart") and Angoulême bleeds out from her wounds. Regis managed to free Ciri from Vilgefortz's lab, and later assisted Geralt and Yennefer in their epic struggle against Vilgefortz. He saved Yennefer's life, but was soon disintegrated by the sorcerer. Nevertheless, Geralt and Yennefer managed to defeat Vilgefortz, and the mage met his end beheaded by the witcher's sword.

### Reunited with Yennefer and Ciri

Geralt was then, at long last, reunited with Ciri. They could not rest yet, as they still had to escape the castle. The trio fought side-by-side against the remains of Stefan Skellen's unit, but before they could escape, the castle was assaulted by the [Nilfgaardian troops](/wiki/Impera_Brigade "Impera Brigade") under the personal command of [Emhyr var Emreis](/wiki/Emhyr_var_Emreis "Emhyr var Emreis"). During a private conversation, Geralt at last realised that Emhyr, Emperor of Nilfgaard, and Duny, [Princess Pavetta](/wiki/Pavetta "Pavetta")'s husband and Ciri's father, are one and the same person. Emhyr then reveales his incestuous plans to marry his own daughter and father a child who, according to [Ithlinne's prophecy](/wiki/Ithlinne%27s_Prophecy "Ithlinne's Prophecy"), will rule the entire world. Geralt denounces Emhyr's plans as monstrous, and the Emperor realises that neither Geralt nor Yennefer would ever let him proceed with his designs, and so decides that they have to die. As a sign of respect for the witcher, Emhyr allows them to commit suicide in private, providing them with a hot bath and a knife.

As they prepare to end their lives, they are suddenly interrupted by Ciri, who reveals that the Emperor and his entire army had simply left the castle (Emhyr, after looking into his daughter's weeping eyes, was ultimately unable to hurt her). The trio, finally reunited and at peace, leave the castle.

### The Rivian Pogrom

Geralt, Ciri and Yennefer, return by horse towards the Northern Realms. On the way, Ciri recounts her entire story, including all the horrors and traumas that were inflicted on her. They pass through Toussaint where, in the town square, Dandelion is about to be executed as he had cheated on Anna Henrietta. Before Geralt could draw blood to defend his friend, the Duchess changed her mind and cancelled the poet's execution, but exiled him from the Duchy and forbade him to ever return.

Geralt, Ciri, Yennefer and Dandelion eventually reach the city of [Rivia](/wiki/Rivia "Rivia"), where they meet [Triss Merigold](/wiki/Triss_Merigold "Triss Merigold") as well as the dwarves [Zoltan](/wiki/Zoltan_Chivay "Zoltan Chivay") and [Yarpen](/wiki/Yarpen_Zigrin "Yarpen Zigrin"). During their stay a [pogrom](/wiki/Rivian_Pogrom "Rivian Pogrom") against the city's [nonhuman](/wiki/Nonhuman "Nonhuman") population begins, and Geralt and his companions (save for Dandelion) fight in defence of the victims. During the fighting Geralt is mortally wounded by a pitchfork, and Yennefer collapses after using all of her power to defend him. The pogrom is ultimately stopped after Triss unleashes powerful fire magic to disperse the mob. Afterwards, Ciri uses her powers to transport the dying Geralt and exhausted Yennefer to the idyllic [Malus Island](/wiki/Malus_Island "Malus Island"), located in a different dimension. Ciri leaves her adoptive parents and teleports herself to yet another dimension. Geralt and Yennefer remain on the island at peace, losing the track of time.

### Riding with the Wild Hunt

After Ciri departed to inhabit another world, Geralt and Yennefer lived together peacefully in a house with an orchard on the [Island of Avallach](/wiki/Malus_Island "Malus Island") and the couple stopped counting time. Tragically the [Wild Hunt](/wiki/Wild_Hunt "Wild Hunt") eventually discovered them, burning down their island and kidnapped Yennefer. Geralt returned to reality and set out on The Path. Over several months, Geralt travelled throughout the Northern Realms in order to find and rescue Yennefer.[[9]](#cite_note-tw2-10)

On September 13, 1269, Geralt crossed [The Ravine of the Hydra](/wiki/Ravine_of_the_Hydra "Ravine of the Hydra") where he saw the elven corpses of the 53 [Vrihedd Brigade](/wiki/Vrihedd_Brigade "Vrihedd Brigade") officers who had been executed and dropped into the chasm. In November, 23, He journeyed to [Cintra](/wiki/Cintra "Cintra"), the village of Coldwater, where he witnessed a victim of The Hunt's wrath, an eleven-year-old boy. On February 24, 1270, Geralt climbed through a high pass in the [Armush Mountains](/wiki/Armush_Mountains "Armush Mountains") and faced off against an imperial manticore. He defeated the old and deadly beast whose pelt helped him to survive the harsh winter conditions. On May 30, 1270, In The Yaruga River, Geralt learned that The Wild Hunt continued their pursuit down south and had taken twenty-three individuals under their command.[[9]](#cite_note-tw2-10)

On July 25, [1270](/wiki/Timeline/Games#1270 "Timeline/Games"), in the forests of [Angren](/wiki/Angren "Angren"), Geralt encountered a witcher named [Letho](/wiki/Letho "Letho") who had been mortally wounded by a [slyzard](/wiki/Slyzard "Slyzard") and saved him. Grateful for his help, Letho informed him about The Wild Hunt 's location and offered his assistance to find them and was accompnaied by his companions [Serrit](/wiki/Serrit "Serrit") and [Auckes](/wiki/Auckes "Auckes"). The group eventually reached up to them on the Winter Solstice, at the [Hanged Man's Tree](/wiki/Hanged_Man%27s_Tree "Hanged Man's Tree") in Nilfgaard. The Witchers fought valiantly against the spectral riders, however despite their combined skill they were outnumbered and unable to defeat them all. Ultimately a stalemate ensued and a deal was made between Geralt and their leader [Eredin](/wiki/Eredin_Br%C3%A9acc_Glas "Eredin Bréacc Glas"). He offered his soul in exchange for Yennefer's, Eredin agreed to his terms and released her.[[9]](#cite_note-tw2-10)

Geralt rode with the Red Riders for an unspecified amount of time. He was eventually released from the Wild Hunt's grip by Ciri who sensed that he was in danger and deposited him in the woods outside of Kaer Morhen. This event caused Geralt to suffer from amnesia and was left with no recollection of his time with The Wild Hunt.[[10]](#cite_note-tw3-11)

### Recovered memories

Six months after the events of [Loc Muinne](/wiki/Loc_Muinne "Loc Muinne"), Geralt having finally recovered his memory, set out on the trail to find Yennefer. He decided to split up from Triss, for reasons unknown and the two went their separate ways. Geralt later reunited with his mentor Vesemir who offered his aid in finding Yennefer. Once the pair hunted down a fiend named [Drugan](/wiki/Drugan "Drugan") in [Vorune](/wiki/Vorune "Vorune").[[10]](#cite_note-tw3-11)

### Killing Monsters

TBA

### Dealing with the griffin

In May [1272](/wiki/Timeline/Games#1272 "Timeline/Games"), Geralt and Vesemir were headed to the village of [Willoughby](/wiki/Willoughby "Willoughby"), following the instructions of a recent [letter](/wiki/Yennefer%27s_letter "Yennefer's letter") from Yennefer, who they were trying to meet up with.[[10]](#cite_note-tw3-11) However, having heard Willoughby had been burned to the ground, they instead stopped in [White Orchard](/wiki/White_Orchard "White Orchard"). In Geralt's search for more information on Yennefer's whereabouts, it eventually led to the two witchers taking on a contract to kill a local griffin in the area. After killing it and learning the sorceress was in Vizima, the two prepared to leave White Orchard but got into a fight in the [inn](/wiki/White_Orchard_inn "White Orchard inn") and ran into no other than Yennefer herself as they left the building, complete with a Nilfgaardian escort. The sorceress explained that Emperor [Emhyr var Emreis](/wiki/Emhyr_var_Emreis "Emhyr var Emreis") had summoned Geralt to Vizima, and that he needed to come with her back to the palace. Saying his goodbyes to Vesemir, Geralt then rode off with the group but soon after the Wild Hunt attacked the group, with only Geralt and Yennefer managing to escape thanks to Yennefer's magic.

### Searching for Ciri

Following the attack from the Wild Hunt, Geralt and Yennefer arrived in Vizima. The witcher met with the emperor, who tasked him with finding Ciri, as she was needed for reasons of state, and the witcher would be well compensated. Accepting the job, he conversed with Yennefer about possible leads. She told him about one of the emperor's spies named [Hendrik](/wiki/Hendrik "Hendrik"), who lived around the [Inn at the Crossroads](/wiki/Inn_at_the_Crossroads "Inn at the Crossroads") in [Velen](/wiki/Velen "Velen"), who she thought might possibly know Ciri's whereabouts. With no time to waste, the two said their farewells and Geralt rode off to Velen.

Geralt eventually found out that Hendrik was living in [Heatherton](/wiki/Heatherton "Heatherton") but found out too late: the Wild Hunt had arrived earlier and tortured Hendrik for information but finally killed the spy after he wouldn't give them anything. Fortunately, Geralt managed to find the spy's hidden room with [notes](/wiki/Hendrik%27s_notes "Hendrik's notes") on possible leads where Ciri was seen, including quarreling with a witch in [Midcopse](/wiki/Midcopse "Midcopse") and in the company of a local called the [Bloody Baron](/wiki/Phillip_Strenger "Phillip Strenger") at [Crow's Perch](/wiki/Crow%27s_Perch "Crow's Perch").

Close to the town of Midcopse, Geralt met with Keira Metz, believing she may have been the witch that Ciri had quarrelled with. She knew nothing of Ciri's whereabouts, but suggested the two meet with an [elven sage](/wiki/Aen_Saevherne "Aen Saevherne") in the underground ruins near [Byways](/wiki/Byways "Byways"), who had met Ciri recently. After arriving, they found that the Wild Hunt had beaten them there, which resulted in Geralt and Keira battling [Nithral](/wiki/Nithral "Nithral"), a general of the Hunt. They found nothing but morphotic projections left for Ciri, mentioning the [Witches of Crookback Bog](/wiki/Crones "Crones"), an ancient threat that Keira explained to Geralt, who was now determined to find them.

Geralt then visited nearby Crow's Perch, and visited the Bloody Baron, who explained his meeting with Ciri and promised more information if he could track down his wife [Anna](/wiki/Anna_Strenger "Anna Strenger"), and daughter [Tamara](/wiki/Tamara_Strenger "Tamara Strenger"), who were both missing. In Anna's room, Geralt found evidence of a fight and stench of wine, which led him to a saffron filled talisman under the floorboards. He tracked the smell of saffron to the basement and found Tamara had constructed a shrine to the [Eternal Fire](/wiki/Eternal_Fire "Eternal Fire"). With enough evidence, he confronted the baron about the signs of fighting, which he was clueless to due to his drinking. Phillip suggested the witcher visit the Pellar at his hut near [Blackbough](/wiki/Blackbough "Blackbough"). At the Pellar's hut, Geralt was tasked with tracking down [Princess](/wiki/Princess_(goat) "Princess (goat)"), the Pellar's goat, as she was needed for a ceremony that could help find Anna and Tamara. After finding the goat and performing the ceremony, the Pellar told Geralt to either lift the curse on a [botchling](/wiki/Botchling "Botchling") or kill it and take its [blood](/wiki/Botchling_blood "Botchling blood").

Lifting the botchling's curse led Geralt to the fisherman [Voytek](/wiki/Voytek "Voytek") at his [hut](/wiki/Voytek%27s_hut "Voytek's hut") near Crow's Perch. Voytek told Geralt his part of Anna and Tamara's story, explaining the same as Keira, that his answer may lie in Crookback Bog. Geralt also travelled to [Oxenfurt](/wiki/Oxenfurt "Oxenfurt"), where he met Tamara, who was alive and well at Voytek's brothers house. With all this information, the witcher returned to the Bloody Baron, who explained some of the times Ciri and him had spent together near the keep. He told the witcher to find his wife and then he would finish his story.

In Crookback Bog, Geralt followed the "Trail of Treats" until he came upon an orphanage. He found [Gran](/wiki/Gran "Gran"), an old woman who was running the orphanage, and a group of kids that led him to [Johnny](/wiki/Johnny "Johnny"), a [godling](/wiki/Godling "Godling") who had lost his voice. After Geralt helped Johnny reclaim [his voice](/wiki/Sealed_bottle "Sealed bottle"), the godling helped him convince Gran to summon the Witches of Crookback Bog. The witches instructed Geralt to travel to [Downwarren](/wiki/Downwarren "Downwarren") and meet the [ealdorman](/wiki/Ealdorman_(Downwarren) "Ealdorman (Downwarren)") there. In Downwarren, the ealdorman asked Geralt to clear an ancient threat at the [Ancient Oak](/wiki/Ancient_Oak "Ancient Oak") nearby.

At the Ancient Oak, Geralt heard whispers around a cave, which led him to the [The Ghost in the Tree](/wiki/The_Ghost_in_the_Tree "The Ghost in the Tree"). The spirit wished Geralt to release her from the captivity of the oak.

After finishing the contract, the ealdorman gave Geralt [payment](/wiki/Ealdorman_of_Downwarren%27s_ear "Ealdorman of Downwarren's ear") and so the witcher headed back into Crookback Bog. The crones poloymorphed and told Geralt of how they had found Ciri near the orphanage, and attempted to eat her before she escaped into the bog. Gran then revealed herself as Anna Strenger, driven crazy by her husband and the bog, now in servitude to the crones.

Back at Crow's Perch, the baron took news of his wife hard and asked the witcher to venture back into the swamp to rescue her with him. He also fulfilled his promise to tell Geralt of where Ciri had gone; toward Novigrad as she was being pursued by the Wild Hunt.

### Business in Ofir

In [1273](/wiki/Timeline/Games#1273 "Timeline/Games"), Geralt was in Novigrad after being seriously injured on a contract. He got into a brawl with a racist, which was promptly broken up by [Master van Schagen](/wiki/Master_van_Schagen "Master van Schagen"), a Redanian man requesting help with a job. He told the witcher of a man creeping into his daughter's room, meanwhile bypassing the guards and remaining silent and unseen. Accepting the contract, the two left for [Van Schagen residence](/wiki/Van_Schagen_residence "Van Schagen residence") to investigate.

That night, Geralt discovered the "ghost" meeting [Celia van Schagen](/wiki/Celia_van_Schagen "Celia van Schagen") was non-other than Dandelion, who was currently courting the young lady. Confronting him, Dandelion revealed he had ended his relationship with Priscilla, and was showing Celia a magic trunk he had won in Oxenfurt. Despites Geralt's warnings, Dandelion read aloud the glowing runes written on the trunk, capturing the two of them and flying them to [Ofir](/wiki/Ofir "Ofir").

Upon arrival, the two left the tower they had landed on top of, and were instantly surrounded by Ofiri guards. They were arrested and taken before [Malliq](/wiki/Malliq "Malliq") [Nibras](/wiki/Nibras "Nibras"), the leader of Ofir, and played innocent with Geralt taking the name of Lambert. Nibras told "Lambert" he must travel to the north, and kill Geralt of Rivia, the witcher that had slayed his son [Sirvat](/wiki/Sirvat "Sirvat"); until this job was completed he would keep Dandelion at the palace as a "guest". That evening, Geralt met with [Radeyah](/wiki/Radeyah "Radeyah"), the crown sorceress who knew his true identity, despite their trickery. She told him about her reviving the maliq's wife [Zaira](/wiki/Zaira "Zaira"), and about the murders that had followed of the concubines of the maliq.

The next morning, Geralt and Radeyah attacked Zaira in the palace gardens, knocking her unconscious. After discovering that she radiated a strong magically aura, they left as [Maraal](/wiki/Maraal "Maraal"), the crown assassin had arrived. He confronted Geralt outside the city gates, and the two fought, with Maraal blind with fury that they had attacked Zaira. Geralt taunted him about a possible secret relationship, and then drove his sword through the assassin's chest.

The sorceress and witcher met in private, discussing the battle, when suddenly they heard a scream outside. [Dayo](/wiki/Dayo "Dayo"), one of the maliq's concubines, had been killed by a djinn. Hours later, they met again in a cave outside the city, where Geralt fought off Falaks in order to collect [sewant mushrooms](/wiki/Sewant_mushrooms "Sewant mushrooms"). They discussed Yennefer before being attacked again, this time by a large insectoid creature.

They next went to the dead mage [Aamad](/wiki/Aamad "Aamad")'s workshop to create Archeus' salt, a substance handy for fighting djinns. Geralt left to find Zaira, who was in the throne room, possessing Nibras. The witcher and sorceress clashed, until Geralt managed to slay her with his sword. He was arrested by the guards, and thrown into jail for her murder. The next day he faced trial, where Nibras sentenced him to be flayed alive. Dandelion defended the witcher, but suggested instead that he be locked in a trunk and thrown in the sea. Standing on the cliff's edge the next day, Geralt was thrown into the sea but activated the magical runes in order to escape drowning.

The next night, Geralt confronted Nemet, the city coroner about where he buried bodies. They found the hole, where Zaira was lying a week deceased, before being attacked by giant [crows](/wiki/Crow "Crow"). Following the battle, Geralt realized they had torn Nemet to pieces, so he left towards the palace alone. He met with Fathaa, who explained the curse and runes better. Before leaving Ofir, the witcher met one last time with Radeyah, revealing that he knew her entire plan to frame Geralt after cursing Zaira. Instead of killing her however, he sent her in a magic trunk to Yennefer. The witcher then left Ofir with Dandelion, boarding a ship at the docks.[[11]](#cite_note-teofaf-12)

Personality
-----------

Most of the time, Geralt could be apathetic, cynical, and threatening. Despite his outwardly cold nature, Dandelion noted that behind his exterior was hiding a fiercely loyal friend, a man of good humour, and someone not indifferent to suffering. Geralt had many good friends all over the [Northern Realms](/wiki/Northern_Kingdoms "Northern Kingdoms"), such as Caldemeyn of Blaviken, [Zoltan Chivay](/wiki/Zoltan_Chivay "Zoltan Chivay"), and of course Dandelion. He was also very protective of and loyal to his friends and companions, and was willing to go to great lengths for those who mattered to him. He could be kind-hearted and caring to the people he loved.

Geralt was also shown to be extremely adept at allaying intense, and at times bleak, situations and as a man who would much sooner have everyone return home than draw their swords. His lifespan made him a world-weary man, often expressing disdain and circuitous insults to those he considered cruel, foolish, etc. He may have risked Temeria's future to save Triss Merigold from the [Nilfgaardians](/wiki/Nilfgaardian_Empire "Nilfgaardian Empire"). He also was shown requesting Scoia'tael to spare Dandelion and kill only him.

Geralt frequently showed remorse and had revelations during his life. Other times he had complete emotional breakdowns, even giving up being a witcher in general and dropping his morals at one point.

Legacy
------

The story of Geralt and Ciri became a popular saga many years, probably centuries, after the actual events had taken place. The chief sources of these stories were Dandelion's ballads and the bard's autobiography *[Half a Century of Poetry](/wiki/Half_a_Century_of_Poetry "Half a Century of Poetry")*. However, Dandelion was not fond of telling the whole truth, and ultimately many versions of Geralt's and Ciri's adventures were spread far and wide, including simplified and harmless children's tales, leading scholars to struggle in distinguishing those stories that were considered canon from those that seemed non-canonical and embellished.

Many years in the future, the sorceress [Nimue verch Wledyr ap Gwyn](/wiki/Nimue_verch_Wledyr_ap_Gwyn "Nimue verch Wledyr ap Gwyn") and her assistant [Condwiramurs Tilly](/wiki/Condwiramurs_Tilly "Condwiramurs Tilly") conducted extensive research into the matter, in an attempt to determine what had really happened to Geralt and Ciri.

### Prologue

After seemingly having been killed by a mob during a [pogrom](/wiki/Pogrom "Pogrom") of [nonhumans](/wiki/Nonhuman "Nonhuman") at the end of the [Witcher saga](/wiki/Witcher_saga "Witcher saga"), Geralt returns to life with no recollection of the details of his sudden reappearance or of the five intervening years. He is rescued by the last remaining witchers in the world and is taken back to Kaer Morhen. There, he is drawn into a complicated conspiracy concerning the witchers, their secrets, and the nefarious forces that are after that knowledge.

Shortly after Geralt's return to Kaer Morhen, an attack is launched on the fortress by an unknown organization, spearheaded by two mages. Though one mage is unknown to her, Triss recognizes the other as [Savolla](/wiki/Savolla "Savolla"). Geralt provides assistance to his friends in repelling the attack, before Vesemir proclaims that the party must split up as the two mages, having unleashed a [frightener](/wiki/Frightener "Frightener") in the main courtyard, have descended into the witchers' laboratory to procure the secrets they are in pursuit of. Vesemir offers Geralt the choice of either going after the mages with Triss, or staying to assist the other witchers in defeating the frightener.

Later, [Leo](/wiki/Leo "Leo") and Geralt find Triss in an injured state, and descend to the laboratory in order to stop the mages from absconding with the secret formulae. When confronted with the witchers, one of the attackers, namely, [The Professor](/wiki/Professor_(assassin) "Professor (assassin)"), kills Leo with a crossbow bolt before teleporting away, along with the mages and a sizeable portion of the witchers' writings.

During Leo's funeral, Vesemir decides that the attackers, known as Salamandra, must be tracked down and forced to pay for their transgressions. He tells Geralt to use Temeria as a starting point in his search, as he once lifted a curse there from Foltest's daughter.

Geralt pursues the mysterious [Salamandra](/wiki/Salamandra "Salamandra"), and in the process meets many people from his past, as well as new acquaintances who either require the witcher's help or offer their own in his quest to regain his identity.

### Chapter I

Vizima is under quarantine due to the [Catriona plague](/wiki/Catriona_plague "Catriona plague"), and Geralt cannot enter it as he lacks the necessary letter of safe conduct. Thus, he settles in Vizima's [outskirts](/wiki/Outskirts "Outskirts"). During the night, Geralt is attacked by spectral hounds, known as [barghests](/wiki/Barghest "Barghest"), which were in pursuit of a woman and child. The witcher manages to rescue a boy named [Alvin](/wiki/Alvin "Alvin"), who levitates and recites [Ithlinne's Prophecy](/wiki/Ithlinne%27s_Prophecy "Ithlinne's Prophecy") in a disturbing voice after the attack, revealing himself to be a [Source](/wiki/Source "Source"). Shortly thereafter, Geralt meets Shani, a red-haired medic hailing from Oxenfurt who arrived here to help quell the Catriona epidemic. She decides to place the now-orphaned Alvin under her care. Geralt also meets the alchemist [Kalkstein](/wiki/Kalkstein "Kalkstein"), a trader named [Declan Leuvaarden](/wiki/Declan_Leuvaarden "Declan Leuvaarden"), and Zoltan Chivay, an old friend from Geralt's past life.

Geralt seeks out the [Reverend](/wiki/Reverend_(Outskirts) "Reverend (Outskirts)"), who agrees to assist him in obtaining passage to the city if he fulfils the contract on [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast"), a certain entity which is thought to be responsible for the barghests. The Reverend sends Geralt to assist three pillars of the community: [Odo](/wiki/Odo_(merchant) "Odo (merchant)"), [Mikul](/wiki/Mikul "Mikul"), and [Haren Brogg](/wiki/Haren_Brogg "Haren Brogg").

The trader Odo tasks Geralt with weeding out the [echinops](/wiki/Echinops "Echinops") in his garden after a session of heavy drinking. Mikul sends the witcher to clear the [local crypt](/wiki/Crypt_in_the_outskirts "Crypt in the outskirts") of ghouls, wherein Geralt discovers the corpse of a poisoned woman. Haren Brogg tasks Geralt with driving away the [drowners](/wiki/Drowner "Drowner") from his goods by the riverbank. It becomes apparent, however, that Haren is actually a hawker, after a regiment of Scoia'tael attempts to take away the goods Geralt was tasked to protect.

The Reverend then offers Geralt to deal with [Abigail](/wiki/Abigail "Abigail"), a local witch, to whom Shani has now transferred her responsibility over Alvin. The witch carries out a magical procedure in which she attempts to communicate with the spirit of the White Frost in Alvin awakened by the Beast. It confers that the Beast's appearance was caused by the sins of the local residents.

Geralt returns to the Inn, wherein he discovers a group of Salamandra fighters assaulting Shani. After dealing with them, the witcher pursues the other members of the Salamandra. Upon reaching their [cavernous lair](/wiki/Salamandra_hideout_in_the_outskirts "Salamandra hideout in the outskirts"), Geralt discovers Alvin inside who was taken from Abigail's home and turned over to the group by the Reverend and his followers. Further along the cave system, Geralt and Alvin meet Abigail, who asks for the witcher's help in fleeing the enraged crowd that has amassed outside. Geralt makes a choice, either to save Abigail from being lynched, or to leave her to the judgment of the Outskirts' residents. After deciding, he defeats the Beast and the barghests.

Later, after receiving a pass into Vizima from the Reverend, or taking it from his corpse, Geralt returns to the Inn, and travels to the city with Shani. However, he is stopped by Mikul at the gates and is turned over to the city guard.

:   *A book entitled "[The Rivian Pogrom](/wiki/The_Rivian_Pogrom "The Rivian Pogrom")" claims that Geralt, known also as the White Wolf, died during a massacre of non-humans. The pogrom took place in the city of [Rivia](/wiki/Rivia "Rivia") just after the second war with Nilfgaard. Geralt was killed by an angry mob when he tried to defend the oppressed. The sorceress Triss Merigold and the dwarf Zoltan Chivay witnessed his death. The witcher's body was never found.*
:   *The bard Dandelion recounts the adventures of the witcher Geralt in his ballads. After reading them, one may conclude that the White Wolf was the most famous witcher of his time. He actively participated in many historical events, such as the mage rebellion on Thanedd Island. Dandelion's poems are mostly devoted to Geralt's fights against monsters, the numerous romantic entanglements for which he is famous, and to his love for a certain sorceress.*
:   *Some years ago, Geralt of Rivia came to King Foltest's court in search of work. He obtained a contract to free the monarch's daughter Adda from a spell which had turned her into a striga, or to kill her if all else failed. The witcher managed to free the girl from the spell, and discovered that one of the courtiers had been responsible for the curse.*

:   *Behold our hero: subjected to mutations and rigorous sword and sorcery training as a child, he has become a superhuman monster slayer. Always penniless and often disdained by those whom he protects, he wanders the world seeking work. Fate has little mercy for him, piling obstacles in his way, yet he trudges on. He has more scruples than a beggaring bum has fleas. Doubts haunt him even when a band of ruffians, knives drawn, approaches him on the highway. Is he a good man? I do not think so. Does he try to maintain his humanity? I believe he does.*

Placed in a boat, he floated into the mist, into a realm where he finally found peace, but not for long. Because of forces mentioned later, Geralt returned just in time to defend the witchers' ancient home fortress, and then embarked on a mission to recover the secrets stolen from it. Along the way he took part in a Scoia'tael uprising, shattered a powerful criminal organization, and killed the Grand Master of the [Order of the Flaming Rose](/wiki/Order_of_the_Flaming_Rose "Order of the Flaming Rose"). All the while his fame as a lover grew. Well, that's Geralt for you. As if all this wasn't enough, he then foiled the attempted assassination of King Foltest of Temeria and became one of the monarch's most trusted men.*

The third installment of the trilogy, like its predecessors, follows Geralt through his final adventures. Following the events of Witcher 2, Geralt has regained his memory of the past and prepares to embark on a new journey. In the Witcher 3, Geralt is on the hunt for the only person he considers kin, Ciri. Along his journey, Geralt must face the Wild Hunt in order to protect the people he cares about.

In the new open world, Geralt has the opportunity to complete quests that are both part of the main story and side quests. He will also interact with old friends Dandelion and Vesemir along with potential lovers Triss Merigold and Yennefer.

### Journal entry

:   *Many cannot fathom the friendship Geralt of Rivia and I, Dandelion, have shared all these years. When we first began breaking bread together, spiteful tongues said he'd be better off cutting my throat and dumping my body in a hollow tree – before I provoked someone else into doing that same to us both. Those individuals spoke out of pure jealousy, for Geralt was my dearest friend, a fact which he gave ample evidence of on numerous occasions.*
:   *I could say a great deal about that world-famous monster hunter, the man known in Elder Speech as Gwynbleidd, or, in our younger (yet no less noble) tongue, as the White Wolf. For Geralt of Rivia is a truly exceptional individual. A brief encounter might tempt one to label him a mere swinger of swords, a simple monster-catcher, a rough-and-tumble practitioner of a dirty trade – but peer closer and you will soon discover he is a man of unplumbed depths, unique views and vast, world-spanning experience.*
:   *On the surface, he is introverted, tight-lipped, and one might even say gruff, but underneath lies an overflowing sea of goodwill, good humour, and an honest readiness to help his friends, be it with a bit of sound advice or the masterful application of his blade.*
:   *Setting aside cumbersome false modesty, I can say that I know his story better than any man alive. I was with him through hard times and good, helping with wise advice, warm words and razor wit. As a result, I am a vital part of his story, both in its earlier and present portions. It is thus my duty to continue my chronicle and, for the benefit of future generations, put in writing the next chapter of his deeds and exploits.*

Geralt of Rivia was one of playable characters in the now defunct MOBA and had a lot of interesting weapons, skills, and skins. He was a warrior class hero.

### Hero description

:   *A witcher, a wandering solution in search of his next problem; a man who's seen as many caves and trolls as he has kings, queens, and courts. In the Arena, Geralt excels as a dueler, but also brings some utility (crowd control support skills) to the table. His first ability (The Way of the Sword) is a three-stage sword attack: Geralt performs a pirouette, then follows it up with two quick slashes. As a witcher, he is also able to wield a simple form of magic called Signs: The Way of Signs enables him to use the Yrden Sign to set a magic trap which slows all opponents in its range. Then there is The Way of Alchemy: after chugging a potion powerful enough to kill one elephant, Geralt gains the strength of three, and his two skills gain new effects: The Way of the Sword now slows enemies, and The Way of Signs now casts the Heliotrope Sign, which not only slows, but also damages opponents.*

:   *Geralt of Rivia—a witcher, a wandering solution in search of his next problem. He is a man who's seen as many caves and trolls as he has kings, queens, and courts. Witchers are mutants, trained from early childhood for one task: to protect the peoples of the Continent from the innumerable foul creatures that inhabit it.*
:   *There are several schools of witchers, represented by the different medallions their members wear around their neck. The wolf medallion Geralt bears warns him of impending danger or nearby magic by gently vibrating. In recent years, the witcher caste has dwindled down to only a handful of active hunters; with so few of them left, the world is beginning to resemble the times before witchers came to be.*
:   *Geralt possesses superhuman reflexes and strength, and his sword fighting skills are second to none. Like every witcher, Geralt fights with two swords: a silver sword, dedicated to combating monsters and creatures of magical origin, and a steel one, primarily used to deal with ferocious animals and the occasional bandit who thinks he can best a master swordsman. Using witcher Signs and special potions, he can tip the scales of any battle in his favor. Being a witcher, Geralt's main occupation is slaying monsters, but he won't hesitate to prove a (usually bloody) point when humans or non-humans try to stand in his way. Geralt strives to maintain his witcher neutrality, but he will sometimes lend a hand to others, even if it drags him into the middle of some mess. Witchers are known for being cold and emotionless due to the mutations they undergo, but Geralt's process must have gone differently, for he is capable of feelings and emotions and a surprising amount of empathy toward others. Living in a world where morality is a concept known mostly to those who aren't hungry, the famous witcher of Rivia remains one of the few beacons of hope...if you have the orens to hire him.*

Notes
-----

### Age

* Geralt's age was not specified in [Andrzej Sapkowski](/wiki/Andrzej_Sapkowski "Andrzej Sapkowski")'s novels until the release of *[Crossroads of Ravens](/wiki/Crossroads_of_Ravens "Crossroads of Ravens")* in 2024, which clarified the date of the character birth as [1211](/wiki/Timeline#1211 "Timeline"), making him 38 years younger than Yennefer who was born [1173](/wiki/Timeline#1173 "Timeline"). This follows on what the author said in *[Nie bądź, kurwa, taki Geralt](http://web.archive.org/web/20000711165544/http://sapkowski.fantasy.art.pl/wywiady/wywiad01.html.po)* interview from 1997, that the protagonist is "over 50, but he tells no one how much over". Sapkowski proceeded to explain that the witchers age slower than ordinary humans and a 60-year-old witcher would look no older than a 45-year-old man. While humans in the world of the Witcher live longer than those from Earth's medieval period, there is still a prejudice towards "giving the job to an old duffer over 50", so Geralt decides to hide his age.
* In turn, the adaptations produced before the release of *[Crossroads of Ravens](/wiki/Crossroads_of_Ravens "Crossroads of Ravens")*, apparently made without awareness of the aforementioned interview, tend to depict Geralt much older. In *[Wiedźmin: Gra Wyobraźni](/wiki/Wied%C5%BAmin:_Gra_Wyobra%C5%BAni "Wiedźmin: Gra Wyobraźni")*, Geralt is born a year earlier than Yennefer (thus 1174 in the correct chronology). In *[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt](/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt")*, set in [1272](/wiki/Timeline/Games#1272 "Timeline/Games"), Vesemir tells Geralt "You're nearly a century old yourself", while [Netflix's *The Witcher*](/wiki/The_Witcher_(TV_series) "The Witcher (TV series)") timeline has him born in [1160](/wiki/Timeline/Netflix#1160 "Timeline/Netflix"), making him 32 years older than Yen who is born in [1192](/wiki/Timeline/Netflix#1192 "Timeline/Netflix") of the show's chronology.
* *[Zdrada](/wiki/Zdrada "Zdrada")* comic book, on the other hand, makes Geralt younger than *[Crossroads of Ravens](/wiki/Crossroads_of_Ravens "Crossroads of Ravens")*, as witcher meets child Dandelion even before graduating Kaer Morhen. In the novels timeline, Dandelion is born in 1229, the year Geralt graduates. It's also possible, however, that instead of making Geralt younger, the comics make Dandelion older.
* A common misconception is that Geralt must have been over a hundred years old because of an assumption that the Kaer Morhen Pogrom marked the end of the [Witcher Trials](/wiki/Witcher_Trials "Witcher Trials") being performed there. This is however incorrect; the School was functioning for years after the massacre, and according to *[Blood of Elves](/wiki/Blood_of_Elves "Blood of Elves")*, the last boys were trained there about 25 years before the events of the novel.

### Other

* Most of *The Witcher 2* promotional screenshots or artwork featuring Geralt display a fairly different model, an early design, even the cover of the game doesn't use the in-game model for Geralt. A different model was planned to replace Geralt's face from *The Witcher*, but due to protests in Poland, CDP edited the old model and placed it into the game.
